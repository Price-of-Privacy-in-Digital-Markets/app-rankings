They will be automatically placed in your AM and/or PM routine as recommended.\n\n\n• ADD CUSTOM PRODUCTS\n\nYou can add custom skincare products from other brands by selecting the option in the top-right menu in the Routine section or from the Custom tab in the Products section.\n\n\n• USE YOUR ROUTINE FOR LAYERING ADVICE\n\nThe products are listed in the recommended layering order, along with advice for when and how to use each product.\n\n\n• KEEP TRACK OF USAGE TO AVOID CONFLICTS\n\nEach morning and evening, check each product off your list to keep track of which treatments you have used. This will allow the app to prevent any conflicts by showing you which products should be avoided.\n\n\n• TRACK YOUR SKIN'S PROGRESS\n\nAny time you notice your skin is looking particularly good or bad, you can make a note of it by pressing on the face icon next to the morning or evening routine. You can also add a comment to note down more details for your own record and add photos to track your progress.\n\n\n• ADD PHOTOS\n\nYou can add photos of your skin to your diary tracker and also add photos of custom products.\n\n\n• REMINDERS & TIMERS\n\nYou can set up notifications to remind you about your daily skin regimen. You can also set timers for products which require a specific wait time. Both can be found in the Settings.\n\n\n\n*** Advanced App Customisation ***\n\n• RE-ORDER YOUR ROUTINE\n\nIf you don't wish to follow the recommended layering order, you can choose to re-order the products to fully customise your routine by selecting the option from the top right menu (with 3 dots) of the Routine section. You can also change the order of the layer steps, for instance DECIEM recommends oils before moisturisers but some users prefer the other way around.\n\n\n• USE CONFLICTING PRODUCTS\n\nWhen we recommend not using a product due to conflicts with other products or because you've reached the usage limit, you can choose to ignore the warning and use it anyway. You will then have the option to permanently ignore conflicts on that specific product.\n\n\n• SCHEDULE PRODUCTS\n\nYou can choose specific days of the week for a product if you wish. For instance, you may wish to make it so that the \"AHA 30% + BHA 2% Peeling Solution\" only appears in your routine on Tuesdays and Fridays.\nYou can also choose dates of the month, e.g. the 1st and 15th of every month.\nAnother useful option is to schedule products for every X days, so you could choose every 2 days to alternate.\n\n\n\n*** Recommended for skin concerns... ***\n\n• Dry & Dehydrated Skin: Achieve plump, healthy-looking hydrated skin.\n• Acne-Prone Skin: Reduce inflammation to help support clear skin.\n• Blemishes & Congestion: Reduce inflammation and brighten the skin.\n• Sensitive Skin: Keep your skin moisturised with this gentle routine.\n• Mature Skin & Wrinkles: Promote youthful skin and reduce the signs of ageing.\n• Pigmentation Problems: Gently exfoliate and brighten skin tone.\n• Oily Skin: Rebalance your skin for a healthy, fresh look.\n\n\nPlease note, Skincare Routine (previously known as \"Skincare Regimen Organiser\") has no connection with DECIEM, The Ordinary or any other skincare brand.",

It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.\n\nFor Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR. Shoot in RAW (even in BURST), split focus / exposure, and manually control everything (exposure, iso, shutter speed, white balance and focus).\n\nFor Everyone Else - inspired by the pro’s we made the interface simple, fast, and easy to use. We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you. If you have any features, ideas, or feedback please email us at hello@shopmoment.com or DM us on Instagram @moment.\n\n## Premium Features\n+ NEW Timelapse mode ($3.99) - capture stunning time-lapse videos.\n+ Slow Shutter mode  ($3.99) - long exposure shots with motion blur and light trails.\n\n## Photography Features\n+ Focus peaking - the green edges will help you dial in your focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ RAW and TIFF - Shoot photos in RAW format for better editing, or TIFF for high-quality printing.\n+ Split Focus and Exposure - Take control of tricky lighting scenarios.\n+ Full Manual - Control shutter speed, iso, exposure, focus, and white balance with easy to use sliders and double taps to reset.\n+ Burst mode - Capture burst shots in RAW format. This is big as now you can capture action with burst but at the uncompressed quality pros want with RAW.\n+ HEIF and HEVC - Seamless support for the latest Apple file formats across photos and videos.\n\n## Filmmaker Features\n+ Focus peaking - the yellow edge glow will help you find dial in the focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ Color Profiles - Select from default, flat, or log color profiles to get the most out of your files in post-processing.\n+ Video Bitrates - Get precise control over video quality with standard, medium, and high bitrates to choose from.\n+ RGB Histogram: Dial in your video color, balance, and exposure with a live RGB histogram.\n+ Waveform monitor - Evaluate video brightness and exposure across your image in real time.\n+ Audio meters - Get just the right sound levels with real-time, precise, dual-channel (when available) audio levels.\n+ Live Histogram - Get your exposure right every time.\n+ Video Stabilization - Make your videos buttery smooth.\n+ Precise Video - Change your resolution and frame rate on screen, without digging into a settings menu.\n+ Anamorphic - Use the Moment Anamorphic lens to shoot amazing, letterbox style photos and videos.\n\n## Works With\n+ Triple/Dual Lens Control - Manually control which side of the triple/dual lens you want to shoot with so you can use Moment lenses over either one.\n+ Moment Lens - select which lens you are shooting with.\n+ Moment Battery Case - Works with the DSLR-like shutter button on our photography cases for half-press and full-press capture.

Using G.L.O.P.P. (Gluon Liquid Omega-Phased Plasma), the maniacal Mech Morphix has transformed the creatures of New York City into an army of bloodthirsty mutants. In Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project, Duke must deploy W.I.N.

Return to a time when the King Of Action didn't need regenerative health or auto-aim - a time when action games were actually about action, an era when heroes had the strength to carry as many guns as they wanted and use as many cheats as they needed. \n\nCelebrate Duke Nukem's 20th anniversary in sunshade-wearing, quick-quipping style with a title that - alongside the re-release of Duke's first two adventures - recognizes a series that's had a tremendous impact on an entire industry, and represents the best of Duke in a way that no other game could.\n\n***   Key Features:   ***\n\nA Good Day To Duke: Rip 'em a new one with 9 brand new weapons, including the G.L.O.P.P.

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",

Handshapes that move are shown as animated GIFs while the rest are static.\n•\tThere are ten colors to choose from: pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, brown, tan and white.\n•\tThere is also an option to filter or display mild profanity.\n•\tEnglish keyboard is available as well.",

    "description": "Pleasure Machine is a simple erotic game for couples with slot machine interface, and is ideal for heating up your foreplay.\n \nThe erotic slot machine features three rotating reels with displayed parts of the human body, erotic activities and time limits. By starting the slot machine, the first partner sets all three reels in motion. After the reels come to a halt, he/she can already look forward to the sweet prize - a random erotic experience being the combination of the activity, at which bodypart to be performed, and for how long. The partners take turns and so after the activity is over the other partner pushes the SPIN button and awaits his/her erotic price.\n \nBut be careful, because it is not always clear who is going to please whom. Each turn is a thrilling experience right to the last moment thanks to the negative time values on the time limit reel. When the negative time limit appears, the partner who spun the reels will treat his/her partner.\n \nIn this game, you can either use the provided slot machines or create your own. You can change the slot machines during the game to accommodate your taste for the softer or more daring tasks.   \n \nFor the quick start, there are five predefined erotic slot machines available, carefully created to avoid unreal combinations. You can adjust each slot machine to suit your preferences, and also to create your own.  There are many possibilities to think of and it’s up to you and your imagination which stimulating combinations you will create.\n \nThis erotic game is suitable for all couples regardless of their sexual orientation. Thus, each couple can spice-up their love life.  \n \nPleasure Machine is a game with erotic content and is for adults only. PLEASE DO NOT INSTALL IF YOU’RE UNDER 18.\n\nGame is also translated in Slovak, Czech and Polish language. You can set those languages directly in the game global settings.",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year. \n  \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves or a White Balance picker. The Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows or sharpen your photo, among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. Use our built-in RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and keep using the tools you are already familiar with.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nEVERYTHING INCLUDED - no IAPs\nCamera+ 2 works great on iPhone and iPad. Use the same tools consistently across all your devices, and take advantage of multitasking in iPad. All features are included in your purchase for all platforms - no in-app purchases required.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.\n\nLIGHTBOX\nPhotos taken with Camera+ 2 go to the Lightbox by default. Filter them easily to focus on the ones you want to work on, and use the built-in editors to create the exact look you are aiming for. Save or share the final versions when you are done.",

    "description": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved",

If you have any problems with our app, then we are happy to help you! Simply send us an email to support@jollylearning.co.uk.\n\nWe're very pleased to announce that 'Jolly Phonics Letter Sounds' has been reviewed by the Educational App Store website and has been awarded their highest certification level of 5 stars!\n\nYou can read the full review here:\nhttp://www.educationalappstore.com/app/jolly-phonics-letter-sounds\n\nApp Overview:\nStart your child’s journey in reading and writing. Join Bee and her friends as they explore the enchanting letter-sounds garden and discover the main 42 letter sounds of English through a series of captivating games. This beautifully animated app enables your child to learn the letter sounds (including digraphs), letter formation, blending the sounds for reading and identifying letter sounds in words for spelling and writing. Together these skills give your child the best possible start as they learn to read and write.\n\nIdeal for children aged 3+, the Jolly Phonics Letter Sounds app provides hours of educational enjoyment.\n\nJolly Phonics leads the teaching of phonics around the world. It is the most effective way to teach reading and writing, enabling children to achieve outstanding results at school and at home. \n\nKey Features:\n◆ Suitable for children aged 3+\n◆ Choice of American or British English audio and spelling (this can be toggled within the information page)\n◆ Choice of print or precursive letters* (this can be toggled within the information page)\n◆ Allows multiple and personalized profiles \n◆ Activities for learning the main sounds in English. The children learn to:\n   ▸ hear the letter sounds\n   ▸ recognize the letter sounds\n   ▸ see letter formation\n   ▸ write the letters themselves \n   ▸ blend sounds in words for reading\n   ▸ identify sounds in words for spelling\n◆ 7 bonus games to unlock\n◆ Tested and loved by children\n◆ Guidance for adults provided\n\nFrequently asked questions\n◆ Why is there no option to take a picture when creating a new plant pot?\nYou need to allow the app to use your device's camera. To do this first close the app, then access the Settings app and scroll down on the left-hand side and touch 'Jolly Phonics Letter Sounds'. You should see a switch to allow the app to access your device's camera. Switch this on, then open the Jolly Phonics Letter Sounds App again.\n\n◆ I can't hear any sound. What can I do?\nThe app now detects if your device sound setting is on mute and displays a speaker button giving an option to override this. Volume controls on the device can then be adjusted as necessary. Headphones can be used at any time to hear sound in the app regardless of whether the device is muted or not.\n\n◆ How do I unlock letter sound groups?\nThe app takes you through each letter sound one at a time. If you wish to unlock subsequent or all letter sound groups (e.g. for teaching purposes), then please read the information page in the app for details of the 'edit mode', accessible via an invisible button.\n\nWhile this App works on iPhones and iPod Touches that meet the minimum requirements, it is best viewed on iPad devices due to the bigger screen size.\n\nPlease note that this app is only available in English but can be set to either American or British English. The app does not contain the Jolly Phonics Actions.\n\n*Precursive letters have joining tails to assist with learning joined-up writing; print letters have no joining tails.",

    "description": "My Baby’s Beat offers a beautiful way for you to bond with your baby during pregnancy. Listen to the fetal sounds in the womb, hear the baby’s heart beat and be as close to him/her as possible.\n \nWith My Baby’s Beat, you can hear your baby’s heartbeat and other fetal sounds in the uterus, and you can do it at home, at your own relaxed environment with just your mobile device. You can record the fetal sounds and share it with your loved ones.\n \n“My Baby's Beat” was the first app to pick up fetal heartbeat sounds using a breakthrough technology. Since it was launched in 2011 it kept improving and constantly maintaining its lead in both popularity and innovation. Since 2011 it has been used by over 1 million parents worldwide!\nUnlike a fetal doppler or other fetal heartbeat monitors, My Baby’s Beat requires no special accessories. It uses the microphone of your mobile device to pick up the sounds in the uterus and the fetal heartbeat.  \n \nFinding the baby’s heartbeat is sometimes a challenging task and requires time and patience. For best results we recommend the following:\n* Use My Baby’s Beat on the 3rd trimester of your pregnancy, as the baby gets bigger, and the fetal heartbeat sounds stronger and easier to find (best after 30 weeks).\n* Follow our help section, watch the tutorial video and listen to the sound samples to know what to expect.\n* Contact our support with any question or inquiry, we’re here to guide you and do our best to help.\n \nThe app does not use any communication such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular. It passively uses the device's internal microphone to pick up the sounds, therefore it is recommended for use in airplane mode. \n \nFor more info, visit: http://www.mybabysbeat.com\n \n* * * PLEASE NOTE * * * \n \nMy Baby’s Beat is not a medical device, has not been reviewed by the FDA or other authorities, and is not intended as a replacement for medical advice of any kind. \nDo not make any medical assumption based on this app! For any medical questions or concerns regarding your pregnancy and your baby’s health, please consult with your doctor/midwife.\n \nTo use our app, you must accept our license terms and privacy policy, which can be viewed by clicking the \"License agreement\" link in the app store.\nPlease make sure to review it, before you download the app.",

    "description": "QUICK SEARCH AND SET OF CONTACTS\nNew utility ICaller from KiraLine Inc is a modern search engine that you can use to very quickly find the person you want and dial his number, irrespective of how large your notebook is. Therefore, this program is particularly useful when driving and when traffic on the road is very slow. Now you just need to type two or three numbers or letters and the utility would display the list of matches, and only need to lightly touch the screen to call the person.\n\nT9 SYSTEM FOR YOUR IPHONE\nYou can search for a contact through the T9 system, which is one of the most popular among mobile phone users around the world. With the T9 system, you type a word, focusing on the keys, each of which has 4-5 letters. Thus, the typing speed increases, while the smart program picks up the word you are looking for.\n\nTWO WORDS IN ONE SEARCH\nWe all come across common names. For example, my phonebook contains 15 people answering Sergeyev, who have different surnames or belong to different aspects of my life. In one of the latest updates, the iCaller developers designed the search system for two words. Use the button \"1\" for additional filtering of contacts.\n\nFAST SMS MESSAGES, AND REMOVAL OF CONTACTS FROM CALL HISTORY\nOur application features maximum functionality at a time and this is of paramount importance to us. You can send SMS from the main screen by swiping your finger over the contact: swiping it in one direction sends SMS, swiping to the other direction deletes a contact from the call history. The same operation is also available from the dial string.\n\nFAVORITE CONTACTS – SELECTED FEATURES\nThe ICaller utility is fully integrated with the phone book, in which you can add and edit contacts, and create a list of up to 50 favorite contacts for speed dialing, adding the photo of a loved one or colleague to the name. You can interchange the position of contact icons, add new ones and instantly dial a number or send an SMS message.\n\nFINE TUNING THE UTILITY FOR YOUR TASTE \nThe program supports advanced options you can use to customize iCaller for yourself. Here, you can enable/disable the sound and tips, and delete call history. In the settings, you can select the priority search by name or surname. This is especially important where two-word search is possible. Screen settings would enable you select the background of the screen, choose the main contact number or display a list to choose from and select the type of image - icons with photos or name of the contact. You can also select the main screen at startup - Favorites or keyboard for searching and dialing a contact.\n\nICALLER SUPPORTS THE MAJOR LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD \nIn the settings, you can choose the primary and secondary language. Note that iCaller supports 5 languages. You can search in Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.\n\nWe welcome your suggestions and feedback at info@kiraline.com.\n\nPlease often go to our official Facebook page for new games and applications!\nwww.facebook.com/kiralineinc",

    "description": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals.",

    "description": "SrutiBox simulates an Indian harmonium, used as a base tone in Indian music and in spiritual practices of chanting and droning. \n\nSrutiBox 1.4 now works under iOS8, iPhone 4,5,6, and 6+ sizes,  has a slightly different look, and fixes a few bugs that you may have encountered.\n\nSrutiBox is a synthesizer, creating drones with various timbres and precise intonations that blur the distinction between tones, timbres and chords. The drone can be fairly static or undergo slow modulation and harmonic change. It now plays in the background under iOS 4.0 like many other music apps!\n\nPop over to http://www.jhhl.net/iPhone/SrutiBox/ and listen to some examples!\n\n\"I wanted you to know that I have made my debut in Vienna a couple of weeks ago as an iPHONEist. \nI played two simultaneously - one with sruti box and the other with a variety of apps.\nI am enjoying sruti box immensely! Thank you!\"\n— Dr. Pauline Oliveros\n\nI also have another Droning app, Droneo, which has a similar interface, but more droning options!\n\nSrutiBox uses 12 \"reeds\" which can be tuned to a great number of scales, randomly detuned, and chorused and modulated. The pitch interval and  volume of each \"reed\" can be set individually, making for a wide variety of drones. The reeds can be set to various timbres suitable for drones, including vocal-like timbres and low frequency-friendly chirps. \n\nA special iPhone feature of SrutiBox is that you can wave the phone in an imitation of pumping the bellows, adding a touch of realism to the simulation. \n\nSrutiBox can also be used as a pitch source for instrument tuning purposes, or as an aid for learning the difference between Just and Equal Tempered intervals. \n\nAs with other iPhone/iPod touch audio applications, it'll sound better through headphones, although in a quiet room, it's quite effective! Make sure to use the volume controls on the side of the phone to set  the volume level you like.\n\nSee the SrutiBox web pages for more information, hints, and possibly tales of YOUR performances and discoveries:\nhttp://www.jhhl.net/iPhone/SrutiBox\n\nIt's also the place to ask for support and advice, or email tutti-srutti at jhhl.net\n\nalso: visit my iPhone App Facebook group for starting discussions etc!\nhttp://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=150360054839 \n\nThank You!\n\nCheck out  my other apps: Droneo, Tondo, the iPhone Wind Chimes, Lake Piano and Enumero!",

    "description": "Know if someone unlocked your screen and is spying on your device! True security against physical access. It works if they know your password and even if no password is set for the lock-screen.\niAmNotified is the solution to definitively secure your device! \nIt acts as a watchdog that lets you know if someone accessed your iPhone or iPad while you were not looking. It can also alert people that you are monitoring the device, discouraging any malicious access.  \n\nNo one can access your device without the password. But...\n\nWhat happens if your sneaky colleague or friend peeks while you type it in? \nWhat if your partner or parents simply demand it? (\"Why don't you give me your password, are you hiding something?\".... does this sound familiar?). \nWhat if someone uses your fingerprint to unlock your device while you sleep? (yeah, it has happened, check the press).\n\nThey would have access to your entire life: pictures, videos, contacts, whatsapp conversations, facebook chats, emails (which mean access to any of your online accounts via password reset), etc.\nThey might even install malware to spy on you remotely!\n\nTHE WORST PART IS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE. \nThat you need to change your password. That a tracking virus is running on your device. That you have to alert your bank. That your competitor has stolen your confidential data.  That your partner knows about \"those\" pictures and conversations and you'd better prepare a good excuse....\nThat people you trust don't respect your privacy!\n\n\n+++ HOW IT WORKS +++\n! THE SIMPLEST APP EVER !\n1. open the App\n2. lock the screen\n\nThat's it! Your device is Secured!\n\nYou will immediately receive a notification on the lock-screen. The notification will remain there until the screen stays locked. If anyone unlocks the screen while you are away, the notification will not be there when you return, alerting you that someone had access to your device.\nThe notification changes every single time for extra security.\n\nThe History Log keeps track of the last notifications shown, so by-passing the system is virtually impossible. \n\n+++FEATURES +++\nDouble Function: use the app with STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS to catch anyone who is spying on you, or with DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS to let everybody know that you are monitoring any access to the device.\n\nYou choose what appears on the notification: \n\n+ STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS (simulate a useful notification, to disguise the true nature of iAmNotified)\n- Lucky Lottery Numbers - [Who doesn't play the lottery?  I mean... free money, right?!]\n- Famous Citations - [Because everyone needs some inspirational quotes every now and then]\n- Definition of a Complex Word - [Education is important! Anyone would want to expand his vocabulary]\n- Fake Stock Exchange Alert - [These are total random companies symbols and values. Not real data to be sued in the stock market!]\n\n+ DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS (showing that you are monitoring the device, will discourage people from accessing it)\n- Custom Message - [You choose what appears on the notification]\n- \"Device locked at: #current date and time#\" - [Shows the time of the last screen lock]\n- \"Access to this device is monitored. Unique notification ID: #securityID#\" \n\n*** PRO OPTIONS ***\nImprove your stealthiness with these advanced options\n\n- Secret Lock -> Launch iAmNotified without anyone near you noticing. When the option is activated, a black dimmed screen is shown when the app is opened, simulating the lock screen. Now you can secretly press the lock button to lock the screen, or wait for it to lock automatically. To access the app with the option activated, simply tap anywhere on the black screen.\n\n- Random Notification Time -> The notification appears at a random time within 2 minutes from the screen lock, instead of immediately after\n\nStart to feel in control of your device!",

It is written by Guru Arjan Dev, the fifth Sikh Guru.\n\nSukhmani Sahib comprises twenty-four Astpadis , each comprising of eight\nPauris. A salok precedes each Astpadi. Also each Pauri consists of 5 salok\n(couplet) consisting of 10 Tuks (lines).\n\nBelow is a table summarising the message of the 24 Astpadis in the Sukhmani\nSahib.\n\n1. Sums up the benefits of contemplation and meditation.\n\n2. Tells us that \"practising holiness\" reduces man's propensity to sin.\n\n3. The Guru states that any study of holy texts, the performance of   austerities. Etc. cannot compare with reading or listening to the Sacred Word.\n\n4. Stresses the need for good behaviour.\n\n5. We learn to thank God for all his various gifts and treasures which He gives us.\n\n6. Examples God's gifts to man: a healthy body, delicacies to eat, silks and jewels to wear and pleasant music to hear.\n\n7. Dwells on the attributes of the saints:\n\n8. Similarly to 7, an appreciation of the God-oriented man- the Brahm-giani -is found here.\n\n9. Guru Arjan defines the various types of holy persons like the Pandit,            Vaishnav, Bhagwati, etc\n\n10. This deals with the various types of people and substances, both good and bad.\n\n11. The Guru tells us that the meek and the humble win God's love, while the haughty and the vain find no peace or joy.\n\n12. Dwells on the lot of the boastful and the arrogant.\n\n13. Tells us of the need to associate with saintly people and of avoiding their slander.\n\n14. Points out that mortals, by their very nature, are fickle and way-ward; so no reliance can be placed on them.\n\n15. Just as darkness is dispelled by light, and wilderness is illuminated by lightning, the Guru's instruction opens up the mind.\n\n16. The Guru refers to God as the Director, Playwright and Actor in His own plays.\n\n17. The Guru emphasizes the qualities of a true servant of God, namely obedience and humility.\n\n18. Stresses the characteristics of a Seeker of Truth.\n\n19. Guru Arjan warns of the distractions of life. Why waste one's life amassing wealth?\n\n20. Deals with the need of efforts for spiritual progress.\n\n21. The Guru tells of the pre-creation state. Before creation, there was a great void.\n\n22. There is a short list of God's attributes. He is the fountain of generosity and goodness.\n\n23. Tells us of the omnipotence of God. He created the fabric of the universe; he controls the stellar bodies.\n\n24. The benefits of the Sukhmani are expounded. The true devotee will be rewarded with health, culture, wisdom, peace, etc.",

Many people, including science and engineering professors, view such skills as important for success in fields like engineering.\" (Gutierrez, Dominguez, & Gonzalez, 2015)\n\nCAN SPATIAL ABILITY BE FURTHER DEVELOPED?\n\n\"The level of spatial performance someone is capable of may change over time. You are likely to gain in performance through practice, training, and learning, but you may also lose in standing relative to others if they acquire more experience that supports their performance or make more progress in their intellectual development.\" (Johns Hopkins University, 2018)\n\nIf you wish to improve or retain the level of your spatial ability, Spatial Roll will be one of the best options.\n\nFleisig, R.
