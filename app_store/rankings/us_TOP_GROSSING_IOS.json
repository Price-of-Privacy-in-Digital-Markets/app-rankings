    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections.\n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes:\n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform.\n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date.\n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes).\nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase.\n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period.\n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store.\n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

Anemo, Electro, Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, Dendro, and Geo interact in all sorts of ways, and Vision wielders have the power to turn this to their advantage.\r\n\r\nWill you vaporize Hydro with Pyro, electro-charge it with Electro, or freeze it with Cryo? Your mastery of the elements will give you the upper hand in battle and exploration.\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL VISUALS\r\n\r\nFeast your eyes on the world around you, with a stunning art style, real-time rendering, and finely tuned character animations delivering you a truly immersive visual experience.

Performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the soundtrack changes seamlessly with the time and gameplay to match the mood.\r\n\r\nBUILD YOUR DREAM TEAM\r\n\r\nTeam up with a diverse cast of characters, each with unique personalities, stories, and abilities. Discover your favorite party combinations and level up your characters to help you vanquish even the most daunting of enemies.\r\n\r\nJOURNEY WITH FRIENDS\r\n\r\nPlay together with friends across various platforms to trigger more elemental action, tackle tricky boss fights, and conquer challenging domains together to reap rich rewards.\r\n\r\nAs you stand atop the peaks of Jueyun Karst and take in the rolling clouds and vast terrain stretching out before you, you may wish to stay in Teyvat a little longer...

    "description": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off dating apps. And it’s working. Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html",

    "description": "Our program has been ranked the #1 Best Diet for Weight Loss 11 years in a row by U.S. News & World Report—and now, it’s even better. The all-new WW PersonalPoints™ Program is our first-ever weight-loss plan built 100% for you.\r\n\r\n\nUsing the very latest nutrition and behavior change science, rigorous testing, and in-depth feedback from our members, we’ve advanced our award-winning algorithm, which boils down the most important, complex nutritional data—including calories, protein, fiber, unsaturated fats vs. saturated fats, natural vs. added sugar—into a single number: the PersonalPoints value.\r\n\r\n\nYour personalized weight-loss plan will guide you toward a nutritious pattern of eating and help you understand patterns to create healthy habits. With WW, everything is on the menu: No food is off-limits! Our new program even allows you to add Points®—a WW first —for doing healthy things like eating non-starchy vegetables, drinking water, and being active.\r\n\r\n\nAs our most personalized and flexible program for sustainable weight management, WW (formerly Weight Watchers) has the tools you need. Unlike other weight-loss programs that only count calories, we know that real success happens when you look at losing weight holistically, from nutrition and movement to mindset and sleep. WW is weight loss that works and wellness that works, so download the WW app now and get a free trial today! After your free trial, plans auto-renew monthly ($24.99 for Digital, $34.99 for Digital 360) unless you cancel before trial ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\nHOW IT WORKS\r\nWW’s team of nutrition and behavioral scientists constantly iterate and assess the most advanced research to power our program.\r\n\r\n\nFood: Learn to incorporate healthier choices into your diet while still losing weight, thanks to your PersonalPoints Budget and ZeroPoint™ foods (which you don’t need to track). Check out our “What’s in Your Fridge?” tool for personalized recipe recommendations based on what you’ve got in the house.\r\n\r\n\nActivity: The activity tracker helps you make progress toward your goals. We'll show you how to sync your fitness device (including Apple Health) and grow your Points Budget by incorporating more activity into your day. Also, enjoy hundreds of on-demand, equipment-free workouts from obé Fitness.\r\n\r\n\nApp features:\r\nweekly check-in\r\nprogress reports\r\nweight loss tracker\r\nsleep tracker\r\nwater tracker\r\nactivity tracker\r\nmeal tracker\r\nbarcode scanner\r\n11,000+ recipes\r\n\r\n\nSleep: Science shows people who get consistently less shut-eye are hungrier throughout the day. Track sleep, relax with Breethe meditations, plus get science-backed strategies from our behavioral psychologists.\r\n\r\n\nMindset: For health and wellness, what’s on your mind is just as important as what’s on your plate. Our team of behavioral psychologists deliver 5-Minute Coaching audios to help you refocus and tackle roadblocks like stress eating.\r\n\r\n\nSupport: With 24/7 Live Coaching, an expert WW Coach is available via chat to answer questions or provide a dose of weight-loss motivation. Plus, we have an exclusive social network to connect with like-minded WW members!\r\n\r\n\nMEMBERSHIP TERMS\r\nFor auto-renewing membership plans, your iTunes account will be charged at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, at the previously selected rate.
