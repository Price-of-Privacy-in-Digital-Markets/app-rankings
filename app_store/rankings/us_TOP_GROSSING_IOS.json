    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections.\n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behavior. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATING, FRIENDS & NETWORKING\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes). \nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

Separated by an unknown god, stripped of your powers, and cast into a deep slumber, you now awake to a world very different from when you first arrived.\n\nThus begins your journey across Teyvat to seek answers from The Seven — the gods of each element. Along the way, prepare to explore every inch of this wondrous world, join forces with a diverse range of characters, and unravel the countless mysteries that Teyvat holds...\n\nMASSIVE OPEN WORLD\n\nClimb any mountain, swim across any river, and glide over the world below, taking in the jaw-dropping scenery each step of the way. And if you stop to investigate a wandering Seelie or strange mechanism, who knows what you might discover?\n\nELEMENTAL COMBAT SYSTEM\n\nHarness the seven elements to unleash elemental reactions. Anemo, Electro, Hydro, Pyro, Cryo, Dendro, and Geo interact in all sorts of ways, and Vision wielders have the power to turn this to their advantage.\n\nWill you vaporize Hydro with Pyro, electro-charge it with Electro, or freeze it with Cryo? Your mastery of the elements will give you the upper hand in battle and exploration.\n\nBEAUTIFUL VISUALS\n\nFeast your eyes on the world around you, with a stunning art style, real-time rendering, and finely tuned character animations delivering you a truly immersive visual experience. Lighting and weather change naturally over time, bringing every detail of Teyvat to life.\n\nSOOTHING SOUNDTRACK\n\nLet the beautiful sounds of Teyvat draw you in as you explore this expansive world. Performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra, the soundtrack changes seamlessly with the time and gameplay to match the mood.\n\nBUILD YOUR DREAM TEAM\n\nTeam up with a diverse cast of characters, each with unique personalities, stories, and abilities. Discover your favorite party combinations and level up your characters to help you vanquish even the most daunting of enemies.\n\nJOURNEY WITH FRIENDS\n\nPlay together with friends across various platforms to trigger more elemental action, tackle tricky boss fights, and conquer challenging domains together to reap rich rewards.\n\nAs you stand atop the peaks of Jueyun Karst and take in the rolling clouds and vast terrain stretching out before you, you may wish to stay in Teyvat a little longer... But until you are reunited with your lost sibling, how can you rest?

    "description": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off dating apps. And it’s working. Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html",

    "description": "We’ve got weight loss down to a science. With WW (Weight Watchers® Reimagined), all you need to do is be you! Let our new, in-depth personal assessment get to know you first—from there, we’ll scientifically match you with a personalized weight-loss plan. Plus, the new myWW+ has even more of what you need to lose weight. Tap, track, and succeed, in one simple-to-use, award-winning app.\n\nWe know that real success comes from tackling the many elements that contribute to weight loss, like nutrition, movement, mindset, and sleep. Download the WW app and enjoy a free trial to see how myWW+ can provide you with more of the tools and support you need to help you reach your wellness goals. It’s our most holistic, most comprehensive program—ever. \n\nTake the myWW+ personal assessment, which gets to know your eating habits and preferences on a deeper level, to get matched with a customized weight-loss plan that can help make losing weight easier. Plus, for the 11th year in a row, we were ranked the “#1 Best Diet for Weight Loss” by U.S. News & World Report in 2021. \n\nHOW IT WORKS \n\nFood: Learn to incorporate healthier choices into your diet and lose weight with a personalized SmartPoints® Budget and ZeroPoint™ food list with hundreds of items you don’t need to track. Check out our new “What’s in Your Fridge?” tool (get easy recipe recommendations based on what you’ve got in the house!), handy Barcode Scanner to scan foods, and extensive food database of 300,000 items combined, including over 9,000 WW recipes, 200,000 branded grocery items, and 86,000 restaurant meals to find exactly what you’re looking for.\n\nActivity: The app's activity tracker helps you make progress towards your fitness goals. We'll show you how to sync your fitness device (including Apple Health) and convert your daily moves into FitPoints®, our measurement for activity. Move more with our updated activity dashboard, which shows a clearer picture of your weekly goals and progress over time. We also have hundreds of on-demand, equipment-free workouts from FitOn and Aaptiv that fit easily in your busy schedule right at home.\n\nNew tracking features: The WW app now includes a weekly check-in, progress reports, and action plans, plus updated sleep tracking, water tracking, and weight tracking. The sleep-weight connection is real—track it and get science-backed strategies for better shut-eye, and set reminders to try new bedtime routines. Tap the “+” icon in the water row on your home screen and watch the levels rise, and now there’s space to note your mood, habits, challenges, proud moments, and future goals with your weigh-in.\n\nMindset: When it comes to health and wellness, what’s on your mind is just as important as what’s on your plate. That’s why WW has partnered with leading meditation and sleep app Headspace® to bring moments of mindfulness and 5-Minute Coaching to your journey.\n\n24/7 LIVE CHAT & COMMUNITY\n\nWith 24/7 Live Coaching, a WW Coach is on standby via chat to answer any question you may have, or to provide a quick dose of motivation.\n \nMEMBERSHIP PRICING & TERMS\n\nIf you choose a WW Digital membership in the app, you will be charged through your iTunes account.\n\nFor auto-renewing membership plans, your iTunes account will be charged at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, at the previously selected rate. Your payment will continue to automatically renew unless you turn off auto-renewal at least 24 hours prior to your next renewal date. Your WW Digital membership can be managed or cancelled in your Apple ID Account Settings. The auto-renewing membership plan is billed monthly and gives you access to our Digital tools.\n\nFor non-renewing membership plans, your iTunes account will be charged once at the time of purchase and will give you access to WW Digital membership for 1 year.\n\nPrivacy Policy: https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/privacy/policy\nTerms of Service: https://www.weightwatchers.com/us/termsandconditions/onlineplus-coaching",

    "description": "Nintendo's hit strategy-RPG Fire Emblem series, which has been going strong for more than 25 years, continues its journey on smart devices.\n\nFight battles customized for touch screens and on-the-go play. Summon characters from across the Fire Emblem universe. Develop your Heroes' skills, and take them to new heights. This is your adventure—a Fire Emblem that's like nothing you've seen before!\n\nThis application is free to download and offers some optional in-app purchases.\n\n■ An epic quest\n\nThe game features an ongoing, original story where new characters and dozens upon dozens of battle-tested Heroes from across the Fire Emblem universe meet.\n\nThere are over 1,300 story stages available as of January 2021! (This total includes all difficulty modes.) Clear these story stages and you'll earn Orbs, which are used for summoning Heroes.\nNew story chapters are added frequently, so don't miss out!\n\n■ Intense battles\n\nTake part in strategic turn-based battles streamlined for on-the-go play with maps that fit in the palm of your hand! You'll need to think hard about the advantages and disadvantages of each Hero's weapon...and even evaluate the map itself as you battle. Lead your army with easy touch-and-drag controls, including the ability to attack by simply swiping an ally over an enemy.\n\nNew to strategic turn-based battles? Don't worry! Use the Auto-Battle option to have your characters fight on their own.\n\n■ Strengthen your favorite Heroes\n\nThere are many ways to strengthen your allies: leveling, skills, weapons, equipable items, and more. Take your characters to greater and greater heights as you battle for victory.\n\n■ Replayable modes\n\nIn addition to the main story, there are many other modes where you can strengthen your allies, compete against other players, and more. \n\n■ Original characters meet legendary Heroes\n\nThe game features numerous Hero characters from the Fire Emblem series and brand-new characters created by artists Yusuke Kozaki, Shigeki Maeshima, and Yoshiku. Some Heroes will fight at your side as allies, while others may stand in your way as fierce enemies to be defeated and added to your army.\n\n* Internet connectivity required to play.

    "description": "Play 2,500+ fun and FREE levels! See why everyone is playing Solitaire TriPeaks!\n\nCards. They’ve been around for literally centuries. They have long-lasting appeal.\n\nSolitaire. Countless hours have passed while people have entertained themselves by playing solitaire. If boredom was as life-threatening as children proclaim, solitaire would have saved tens, possibly hundreds, of millions of lives. No joke.\n\nTriPeaks. Arguably the most fun Solitaire game of them all.\n\nSolitaire TriPeaks. No doubt about it - *the* most fun TriPeaks version out there. It’s a little bit Golf, it’s a little bit Pyramid, and it’s a whole lot of depth. It’s a deep game, my friend. A very deep game.\n\nHere’s the deal. You’ve got the basics - the game itself. Then you throw in things like unique Hazards and Boosters, Wild Cards, a whole slew of tableau setups, and you’re just skimming the surface. You keep on playing, and then you’ll discover whole new worlds - tons of levels, Clubs, leagues, the ability to chat with your Club Members, a Friend Center, and events that will challenge your mind, and satisfy your soul. We don’t play the hyperbole game. We state the facts.\n\nOh, and lest we forget, this game is like being on a vacation with a cast of some crazy characters you’ll likely fall in love with pretty quick. There are the two hosts to the game, Tiki and Poi. Tiki’s a Tiki - nobody really knows what the heck he is, and that’s just how it is. And Poi? He’s his adorable dog and sidekick. Together, they’ll make you laugh and keep you inspired to take on the next level. Then there are other characters as you move through the game, like Pele, the Volcano Goddess. Don’t mess with her. And Marina, she’s as sweet as sweet can be. There are penguins, bunnies, monkeys, a parrot and a curmudgeonly old Pirate named Captain Karma.\n\nAlso, there’s the art. You won’t believe the art in these levels - it’s like out of this world, my friend. Every level provides an enticing background. Some make you want to take a vacation on the beach. Others make you want to fly in space, or delve the deepest depths of the ocean.\n\nThere you have it. Download this one game today, and you won’t be searching the app store for much anymore.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\nhttp://gsngamesnetwork.com/privacy.html",

At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in heart-pounding MOBA competition.\n\n6.
