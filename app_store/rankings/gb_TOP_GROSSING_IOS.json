    "description": "With 30 billion matches to date, Tinder® is the world’s most popular app for meeting new people. Think of us as your most dependable wingmate — wherever you go, we’ll be there. If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, come on over.\n\nMORE FEATURES? THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you. Think of it as your personal Tinder concierge — available 24/7 — bringing all of your pending matches to you. Now you can sit back, enjoy a fine cocktail and browse through profiles in your own time. Goodbye search fatigue. Hello #GoldLife\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you choose to purchase Tinder Plus or Tinder Gold, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.

    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections.\n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS & NETWORK\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes). \nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

    "description": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off dating apps. And it’s working. Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html",
