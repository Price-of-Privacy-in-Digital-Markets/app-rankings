    "description": "With 30 billion matches to date, Tinder® is the world’s most popular app for meeting new people. Think of us as your most dependable wingmate — wherever you go, we’ll be there. If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, come on over.\n\nMORE FEATURES? THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you. Think of it as your personal Tinder concierge — available 24/7 — bringing all of your pending matches to you. Now you can sit back, enjoy a fine cocktail and browse through profiles in your own time. Goodbye search fatigue.

    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. \n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day. \n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS, NETWORK \n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\nBumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way. \nBumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends. \nBumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities. \n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME \n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen billions of messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL \n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company) \n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired) \n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times) \n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard) \n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider) \n\n--- \n\nBumble is free to download and use, and that will never change for our main features. However, if you’re looking to get the most from Bumble, you can subscribe to one of our optional subscription products, Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium. \nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app. \n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. \n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable \n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free. \n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions: \nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy \nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

    "description": "We’ve got weight loss down to a science. With WW (Weight Watchers® Reimagined), all you need to do is be you! Let our new, in-depth personal assessment get to know you first - from there, we’ll scientifically match you with a personalised weight-loss plan. Plus, the new myWW+ has even more of what you need to lose weight. Tap, track, and succeed, in one simple-to-use, award-winning app.\n\nWe know that real success comes from tackling the many elements that contribute to weight loss, like nutrition, movement, mindset, and sleep. Download the WW app and enjoy a free trial to see how myWW+ can provide you with more of the tools and support you need to help you reach your wellness goals. It’s our most holistic, most comprehensive programme - ever. \n\nTake the myWW+ personal assessment, which gets to know your eating habits and preferences on a deeper level, to get matched with a customised weight loss plan that can help make losing weight easier. Plus, for the 11th year in a row, we were ranked the “#1 Best Diet for Weight Loss” by U.S. News & World Report in 2021. \n\nHOW IT WORKS \n\nFood: Learn to incorporate healthier choices into your diet and lose weight with a personalised SmartPoints® Budget and ZeroPoint™ food list with hundreds of items you don’t need to track. Check out our new “What’s in Your Fridge?” tool (get easy recipe recommendations based on what you’ve got in the house!), handy Barcode Scanner to scan foods, and an extensive food database of 50,000 items combined, including over 2,000 WW recipes, 42,000 grocery items, and 6,000 restaurant meals to find exactly what you’re looking for.\n\nActivity: The app's activity tracker helps you make progress towards your fitness goals. We'll show you how to sync your fitness device (including Apple Health) and convert your daily moves into FitPoints®, our measurement for activity. Move more with our updated activity dashboard, which shows a clearer picture of your weekly goals and progress over time. We also have hundreds of on-demand, equipment-free workouts from FitOn and Aaptiv that fit easily in your busy schedule right at home.\n\nNew tracking features: The WW app now includes a weekly check-in, progress reports, and action plans, plus updated sleep tracking, water tracking, and weight tracking. The sleep-weight connection is real - track it and get science-backed strategies for better shut-eye, and set reminders to try new bedtime routines. Tap the “+” icon in the water row on your home screen and watch the levels rise, and now there’s space to note your mood, habits, challenges, proud moments, and future goals with your weigh-in.\n\nMindset: When it comes to health and wellness, what’s on your mind is just as important as what’s on your plate. That’s why WW has partnered with leading meditation and sleep app Headspace® to bring moments of mindfulness and 5-Minute Coaching to your journey.\n\n24/7 LIVE CHAT & COMMUNITY\n\nWith 24/7 Live Coaching, a WW Coach is on standby via chat to answer any question you may have, or to provide a quick dose of motivation.\n \nMEMBERSHIP PRICING & TERMS\n\nIf you choose a WW Digital membership in the app, you will be charged through your iTunes account.\n\nFor auto-renewing membership plans, your iTunes account will be charged at least 24 hours prior to the end of the current period, at the previously selected rate.

    "description": "Kiss of War is a war strategy game set in the late modern period. It tells a story about a group of charming women with different pasts fighting against the Invaders with allies. You will play as a Commander in the game. Train powerful troops and recruit beautiful female Officers to lead. Unite other Commanders to eliminate the Invaders and finally achieve world peace by establishing a stronger Guild!\r\n\r\n1. Brand New Troop Control System\r\nThe game uses a new free control system that allows players to command multiple troops to march, garrison, and change targets and marching routes on the battlefield. Strong troops cannot prevail without excellent leadership and strategies!\r\n\r\n2. Vivid War Scenes\r\nWe have created vivid cities and battlefields based on actual geography from the late modern Europe, including landmarks that people will recognize. Plus, we have also simulated the famous war machines used during the late modern period, which aim to bringing you back to the era when legends emerged.\r\n\r\n3. Real-time Multiplayer Combat\r\nFighting against real players is always more complicated and appealing than battling the AI. You still need help from other players, even when you're strong because you won't be fighting against one opponent. It could be an entire Guild, or even more.\r\n\r\n4. Multiple Countries to Select\r\nYou can choose different countries to play in the game. Each country has its own Country Trait, and the combat units unique to each country are all famous war machines that served the countries throughout history. You can lead the army that you want in the game, and launch attacks on your enemies!\r\nMillions of players have joined this legendary battlefield. Expand your Guild, show your power, and conquer this land!\r\n\r\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/kissofwaronline/",
