    "description": "Simple. Reliable. Secure. — WhatsApp from Facebook\n\nWhatsApp Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for iPhone and other smartphones. WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\n\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:\n\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\n\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\n\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp).\n\n• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.\n\n• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.*\n\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book.\n\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out.\n\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \nWe're always excited to hear from you! If you have feedback, questions, or concerns, please email us at:\niphone-support@whatsapp.com\n\nor follow us on twitter:\n\nhttp://twitter.com/WhatsApp\n@WhatsApp\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: WhatsApp is a telephony app, so iPod and iPad are not supported devices.",

If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, come on over.\n\nMORE FEATURES? THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you. Think of it as your personal Tinder concierge — available 24/7 — bringing all of your pending matches to you. Now you can sit back, enjoy a fine cocktail and browse through profiles in your own time. Goodbye search fatigue.

Over 400 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.\n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made.

Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

Open a full UK bank account from your phone, for free.\n\n• Or move everything to Monzo using the free Current Account Switch Service. It's fully guaranteed, takes one week and we can set it up in minutes.\n\nPICK AN ACCOUNT THAT SUITS YOU\n\nIt's our mission to make money work for everyone, so we've created different accounts for different needs.\n\n• Monzo Plus\nThe account that puts money in your hands. Full financial visibility, with your other bank accounts and credit cards all in one place. Get interest on your money, personalised budgeting, a holographic card and so much more.\n\n• Monzo \nOur original, free account. With instant spending notifications, easy ways to send money, Pots for separating your savings and more.\n\n• Monzo Joint Accounts\nBring your money together with our free joint account. Pool your resources with someone to make life easier to manage. See who's paying for what, set spending budgets and we'll send both of you a separate card.\n\n• Monzo Business Lite\nThe best of Monzo but for your business, with no monthly fee. A full UK current account including mobile and web access, free instant UK bank transfers, budgeting, digital receipts, award-winning customer support and more.  \n\n• Monzo Business Pro\nYour business' finances taken care of, for £5 a month. A full UK current account including everything in Business Lite, plus Tax Pots, integrated accounting, multi-user access for limited companies, invoicing and more.\n\nKEEP YOUR MONEY SAFE\n\n• Just like any other bank, your eligible deposits up to £85,000 are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (or FSCS for short).\n\n• And compared to other UK banks, we're 4x better at stopping card fraud, and 3x better at stopping identity theft.\n\nMANAGE YOUR SPENDING\n\n• Get notified the second you pay, set budgets for things like groceries and going out, and get warnings if you're spending too fast (if you want them). Plus, fee-free spending abroad, and we don't mark up the exchange rate.\n\nGET ON TOP OF YOUR BILLS\n\n• Pick a Pot to pay bills from, so you can't accidentally spend the rent. We'll tell you if they're higher for the upcoming month, and remind you if you're running low. When they're due, we pay them for you - easy.\n\nSAVE FOR THINGS THAT MATTER\n\n• Earn interest from a growing number of savings options. Automatically put money aside when you spend, round up payments to watch the pennies turn into pounds, and choose images to stay focused on your goals.\n\nGETTING PAID WITH MONZO IS MAGIC\n\n• If you're paid by Bacs (most people are!), then we can advance you your salary a day early, for free. Then effortlessly sort your salary between spending, bills and savings. All your money neatly separated so you can't overspend, but still under one roof. A heads up: we can stop offering get paid early, or change this service, at any time.\n\nAND THERE'S MORE...\n\n• Easy, instant bank transfers. Split bills with a tap, and send money with just a link, or over bluetooth to anyone nearby. And we're here with friendly human help, if you need us.\n\nBUILDING WITH YOU\n\n• We've built a new kind of bank, and we've built it together. We care about being open and doing what's right by our customers.\n\n• Our community of customers are at the heart of everything we do: they chose our name, have suggested features and helped us decide what to build. We'd love you to join them.\n\nDON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT\n\n\"Monzo?

    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. \n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day. \n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS, NETWORK \n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\nBumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way. \nBumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends. \nBumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities. \n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME \n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen billions of messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL \n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company) \n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired) \n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times) \n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard) \n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider) \n\n--- \n\nBumble is free to download and use, and that will never change for our main features. However, if you’re looking to get the most from Bumble, you can subscribe to our optional subscription product Bumble Boost. We offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app. \n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. \n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable \n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free. \n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions: \nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy \nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

Just tell us how and where to deliver from the range of options available and we’ll do the rest.\n\n\n• Personal delivery preferences - if you’re not going to be in, you can use the DPD app to make sure you can still receive your parcels.  Tell us to deliver straight to your chosen DPD Pickup location or, to your chosen neighbour or safe place.  You select your preferences and we’ll make sure we follow your instructions every time!\n\n• 30-minute delivery alerts - we don’t want you to wait in all day so with all your DPD deliveries, we’ll let you know in advance when to expect delivery and when we are just 30 minutes away. \n\n• Active and previous deliveries - using the DPD app you can see a list of current deliveries and track when your parcels will be with you. When we’ve delivered to your chosen safe place we’ll even send you photos of your parcel in that location for added peace of mind.\n\n• Multiple addresses - set your work, home, or even family member’s address preference, so you can tailor your delivery experience and still get your deliveries, wherever you are in the UK.\n\n• Driver tracking - see the name and a picture of your driver or why not track their location and find out where you are in the delivery queue. See your driver's estimated arrival time so you know when to expect your parcel.\n\n• In flight options - when we’re on our way to you, if your plans change you can still rearrange your delivery right up until we deliver your parcel. You can instruct our driver to deliver on a different day, to a preferred neighbour, to a safe place or even to one of our 2,500 DPD Pickup shops.\n\n• Pickup shops - if you’re collecting your parcel from a nearby DPD Pickup shop, get opening hours, your pickup pass for collection and directions from your delivery address.\n\n***Existing users Please note: Thinking of deleting our app?
