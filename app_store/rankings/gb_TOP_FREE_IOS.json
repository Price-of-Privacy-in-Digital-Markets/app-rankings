Get started with 1SE today!\n\n2x winner of the “Best Use of a Mobile Camera” WEBBY Award.\nFeatured by Apple, BBC, TED, CNN, Fast Company and more!\n\n\"For over 10 years, I’ve been recording 1 second every day, so I’ll never forget another day ever again. This project had such a positive impact on my day-to-day life after a few months, that I dedicated my life to making a mobile app which would make it easy for anyone to do this too. Being able to relive every single day has provided me with a treasured perspective on life. It holds me accountable for making each day notable. When I turned 40, I had a 1-hour movie that encapsulated my 30s. If I live to see 80 years of age, I’ll have a 5-hour video that summarizes 50 years of my life.\"\n\n- Cesar Kuriyama, 1SE Founder\n\n\nWhy 1SE is awesome:\n\n- AD FREE: 1SE is free to use without ads!\n\n- AUTO-FILL: Don't know where to start?

You're in control.\n\n- 2 KINDS OF PROJECTS: Start out with two different styles of projects, ‘Freestyle’ for events or trips and ‘Journal’ for a classic day to day video diary.\n\n- NOTES: Take note of your day and leave a private message for yourself.\n\n- REMINDERS: Set up friendly creative reminders, so you never forget a day!\n\n- PRIVACY: Your seconds are never shared with anyone unless you decide to do it.\n\nOur core app is free to use but if you want to help support our growing team while gaining access to more features try 1SE Pro!\n\n\n1SE PRO FEATURES:\n- Collaboration: Invite your friends to collaborate on videos and remember your life together.\n- Unlimited backup: Secure your life’s most precious memories and never lose them again!\n- Unlimited projects: Create as many Freestyle or Journal projects as you want.\n- Multiple snippets a day: Up to two separate snippets in a day.\n- Longer snippets: Capture up to 10 seconds per snippet!\n- Add music: Gain access to royalty-free songs and add some music to your mashes!\n- Brightness: Edit the shadows and exposure with our updated snippet selector.\n- Remove 1SE Branding: Remove the date and logo at the end of your videos.\n\n\nPro & Subscription FAQ: https://help.1se.co/pro-faq\nPrivacy Policy: https://1se.co/privacy/\nTerms of Use: https://1se.co/terms-service\n\nWe love your feedback and appreciate your reviews.

One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

    "description": "With 30 billion matches to date, Tinder® is the world’s most popular app for meeting new people. Think of us as your most dependable wingmate — wherever you go, we’ll be there. If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, come on over.\n\nMORE FEATURES? THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you. Think of it as your personal Tinder concierge — available 24/7 — bringing all of your pending matches to you. Now you can sit back, enjoy a fine cocktail and browse through profiles in your own time. Goodbye search fatigue. Hello #GoldLife\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you choose to purchase Tinder Plus or Tinder Gold, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.

Pots keep cash separate from your main balance – like bills, groceries and holidays. So you can cover regular outgoings (and look after your savings) without having to dip into your everyday balance.\n\n• Instant updates\n\nMonzo sends you instant notifications every time money enters or leaves your bank account, so you never miss a beat.\n\nJust been paid? We'll tell you. Takeaway ordered? We'll tell you. Booked an underwater pottery class? You guessed it, we'll tell you.\n\n• Leave the maths to Monzo\n\nSplit bills, share tabs and send money in a few taps from your Monzo app. So there's no need to pore over a receipt after dinner with friends or send awkward pay-me-back texts the next day. \n\n• A better way to pay later\n\nMonzo Flex is a great way to spread the cost of purchases, and you can use it pretty much anywhere you use Monzo, on pretty much whatever you want. One up-front application and, if eligible, a pre-agreed credit limit, all in your Monzo app with 3 instalments at 0% interest, or 6 and 12 instalments at 19% APR (variable). You can even turn back the clock and use Flex on an existing Monzo transaction made in the last two weeks.\n\n• Rest easy\n\nYour eligible deposits in Monzo are protected by The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) up to a value of £85,000 per person. \n\nSee a payment on your account you're not too sure about? Freeze your card in one tap to keep your account safe. And if it turns out to be that late night pizza you forgot you ordered, you can defrost your card and keep on using it.\n\nMONZO PLUS\n\nUpgrade your personal account to Monzo Plus to unlock amazing features that'll help you achieve your goals faster, and get a shiny new holographic card too.\n\nConnect your other bank accounts and credit cards to get full visibility of all your finances. Get personalised insights into your money so you know what to cut down, or keep doing. Pay for upcoming holidays or particular purchases directly from set budgets for pure separation of your spending. \n\nAll this and much more when you subscribe to Monzo Plus for £5 a month for a minimum of 3 months (you'll need to be over 18).\n\nMONZO PREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to Monzo Premium to get everything you get with Monzo Plus, as well as a metal debit card made from a single sheet of steel, extensive insurance cover and more. \n\nKnow that you're taken care of with worldwide, multi-trip travel insurance covering you and your family.\n\nAlso included is full phone insurance, covering theft, loss and accidental damage – even cracked screens – of phones worth up to £2,000. After all, what good would a mobile bank be if we didn't look after the place we live? Read the Ts&Cs for the full details. \n\nAll this and more when you subscribe to Monzo Premium for £15 a month for a minimum of 6 months (and you'll need to be 18-69 years old).\n\nMONZO BUSINESS LITE\n\nLooking for a business account that just works, so you can too? Stay on top of your capital budgeting without paying a penny with Monzo Business Lite. Use the Get Paid tab to create payment links in seconds, offer customers simple ways to pay by card or easy bank transfer, and track all your payments at a glance.\n\nMONZO BUSINESS PRO \n\nTake your business finances to the next level with Monzo Business Pro for £5 a month. On top of everything you get with Monzo Business Lite, Monzo Business Pro lets you create invoices your customers can pay in a few taps, so you can get paid the easy way. Integrate your accounting tools and enjoy exclusive offers, like free use of cloud accounting platform Xero for 6 months. \n\n\nMonzo Bank Limited is a company registered in England and Wales (No. 09446231).
