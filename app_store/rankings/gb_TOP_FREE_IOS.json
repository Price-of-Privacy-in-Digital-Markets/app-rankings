    "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

    "description": "Use Microsoft Authenticator for easy, secure sign-ins for all your online accounts using multi-factor authentication, passwordless, or password autofill. You also have additional account management options for your Microsoft personal, work or school accounts.\n\nGetting started with multi-factor authentication\n\nMulti factor authentication (MFA)provides a second layer of security. When enabled, during login after entering your password, you’ll be asked for an additional way to prove it’s really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the one-time password (OTP) generated by the app. The OTP codes have a 30 second timer counting down. This timer is so you never have to use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and you don’t have to remember the number. The OTP doesn’t require you to be connected to a network, and it won’t drain your battery. You can add multiple accounts to your app, including non-Microsoft accounts like Facebook, Amazon, Dropbox, Google, LinkedIn, GitHub, and more.\n\nGetting started with passwordless\n\nUse your phone, not your password, to log into your Microsoft account. Just enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two-step verification process. After you’ve signed in with two factor authentication (2FA), you’ll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nGetting started with autofill\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator app can also autofill passwords for you. Sign-in on the Passwords tab inside the Authenticator app with your personal Microsoft account to start syncing passwords, including the passwords saved in Microsoft Edge. Make Microsoft Authenticator the default autofill provider and start autofilling passwords on apps and sites you visit on your mobile. Your passwords are protected with multi-factor authentication in the app. You will need to prove yourself with your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN to access and autofill passwords on your mobile. You can also import passwords from Google Chrome and other password managers.\n\nMicrosoft personal, work or school accounts\n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain organization resources. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each.",

Pots keep cash separate from your main balance – like bills, groceries and holidays. So you can cover regular outgoings (and look after your savings) without having to dip into your everyday balance.\n\n• Instant updates\n\nMonzo sends you instant notifications every time money enters or leaves your bank account, so you never miss a beat.\n\nJust been paid? We'll tell you. Takeaway ordered? We'll tell you. Booked an underwater pottery class? You guessed it, we'll tell you.\n\n• Leave the maths to Monzo\n\nSplit bills, share tabs and send money in a few taps from your Monzo app. So there's no need to pore over a receipt after dinner with friends or send awkward pay-me-back texts the next day. \n\n• A better way to pay later\n\nMonzo Flex is a great way to spread the cost of purchases, and you can use it pretty much anywhere you use Monzo, on pretty much whatever you want. One up-front application and, if eligible, a pre-agreed credit limit, all in your Monzo app with 3 instalments at 0% interest, or 6 and 12 instalments at 19% APR (variable). You can even turn back the clock and use Flex on an existing Monzo transaction made in the last two weeks.\n\n• Rest easy\n\nYour eligible deposits in Monzo are protected by The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) up to a value of £85,000 per person. \n\nSee a payment on your account you're not too sure about? Freeze your card in one tap to keep your account safe. And if it turns out to be that late night pizza you forgot you ordered, you can defrost your card and keep on using it.\n\nMONZO PLUS\n\nUpgrade your personal account to Monzo Plus to unlock amazing features that'll help you achieve your goals faster, and get a shiny new holographic card too.\n\nConnect your other bank accounts and credit cards to get full visibility of all your finances. Get personalised insights into your money so you know what to cut down, or keep doing. Pay for upcoming holidays or particular purchases directly from set budgets for pure separation of your spending. \n\nAll this and much more when you subscribe to Monzo Plus for £5 a month for a minimum of 3 months (you'll need to be over 18).\n\nMONZO PREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to Monzo Premium to get everything you get with Monzo Plus, as well as a metal debit card made from a single sheet of steel, extensive insurance cover and more. \n\nKnow that you're taken care of with worldwide, multi-trip travel insurance covering you and your family.\n\nAlso included is full phone insurance, covering theft, loss and accidental damage – even cracked screens – of phones worth up to £2,000. After all, what good would a mobile bank be if we didn't look after the place we live? Read the Ts&Cs for the full details. \n\nAll this and more when you subscribe to Monzo Premium for £15 a month for a minimum of 6 months (and you'll need to be 18-69 years old).\n\nMONZO BUSINESS LITE\n\nLooking for a business account that just works, so you can too? Stay on top of your capital budgeting without paying a penny with Monzo Business Lite. Use the Get Paid tab to create payment links in seconds, offer customers simple ways to pay by card or easy bank transfer, and track all your payments at a glance.\n\nMONZO BUSINESS PRO \n\nTake your business finances to the next level with Monzo Business Pro for £5 a month. On top of everything you get with Monzo Business Lite, Monzo Business Pro lets you create invoices your customers can pay in a few taps, so you can get paid the easy way. Integrate your accounting tools and enjoy exclusive offers, like free use of cloud accounting platform Xero for 6 months. \n\n\nMonzo Bank Limited is a company registered in England and Wales (No. 09446231).

    "description": "With 30 billion matches to date, Tinder® is the world’s most popular app for meeting new people. Think of us as your most dependable wingmate — wherever you go, we’ll be there. If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, come on over.\n\nMORE FEATURES? THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you. Think of it as your personal Tinder concierge — available 24/7 — bringing all of your pending matches to you. Now you can sit back, enjoy a fine cocktail and browse through profiles in your own time. Goodbye search fatigue.
