Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After, you'll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication for work, school, and non-Microsoft accounts. The app provides a second layer of security after your password. When logging in, you'll enter your password, and then you'll be asked for an additional way to prove it's really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the verification code generated by the app.  \n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.",

One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, come on over.\n\nMORE FEATURES? THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you. Think of it as your personal Tinder concierge — available 24/7 — bringing all of your pending matches to you. Now you can sit back, enjoy a fine cocktail and browse through profiles in your own time. Goodbye search fatigue.

A full UK current account including everything in Business Lite, plus Tax Pots, integrated accounting, multi-user access for limited companies, invoicing and more.\n\nKEEP YOUR MONEY SAFE\n\n• Just like any other bank, your eligible deposits up to £85,000 are protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (or FSCS for short).\n\n• And compared to other UK banks, we're 4x better at stopping card fraud, and 3x better at stopping identity theft.\n\nMANAGE YOUR SPENDING\n\n• Get notified the second you pay, set budgets for things like groceries and going out, and get warnings if you're spending too fast (if you want them). Plus, fee-free spending abroad, and we don't mark up the exchange rate.\n\nGET ON TOP OF YOUR BILLS\n\n• Pick a Pot to pay bills from, so you can't accidentally spend the rent. We'll tell you if they're higher for the upcoming month, and remind you if you're running low. When they're due, we pay them for you - easy.\n\nSAVE FOR THINGS THAT MATTER\n\n• Earn interest from a growing number of savings options. Automatically put money aside when you spend, round up payments to watch the pennies turn into pounds, and choose images to stay focused on your goals.\n\nGETTING PAID WITH MONZO IS MAGIC\n\n• If you're paid by Bacs (most people are!), then we can advance you your salary a day early, for free. Then effortlessly sort your salary between spending, bills and savings. All your money neatly separated so you can't overspend, but still under one roof. A heads up: we can stop offering get paid early, or change this service, at any time.\n\nAND THERE'S MORE...\n\n• Easy, instant bank transfers. Split bills with a tap, and send money with just a link, or over bluetooth to anyone nearby. And we're here with friendly human help, if you need us.\n\nBUILDING WITH YOU\n\n• We've built a new kind of bank, and we've built it together. We care about being open and doing what's right by our customers.\n\n• Our community of customers are at the heart of everything we do: they chose our name, have suggested features and helped us decide what to build. We'd love you to join them.\n\nDON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT\n\n\"Monzo?

    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections.\n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS & NETWORK\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes). \nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

Just tell us how and where to deliver from the range of options available and we’ll do the rest.\n\n\n• Personal delivery preferences - if you’re not going to be in, you can use the DPD app to make sure you can still receive your parcels.  Tell us to deliver straight to your chosen DPD Pickup location or, to your chosen neighbour or safe place.  You select your preferences and we’ll make sure we follow your instructions every time!\n\n• 30-minute delivery alerts - we don’t want you to wait in all day so with all your DPD deliveries, we’ll let you know in advance when to expect delivery and when we are just 30 minutes away. \n\n• Active and previous deliveries - using the DPD app you can see a list of current deliveries and track when your parcels will be with you. When we’ve delivered to your chosen safe place we’ll even send you photos of your parcel in that location for added peace of mind.\n\n• Multiple addresses - set your work, home, or even family member’s address preference, so you can tailor your delivery experience and still get your deliveries, wherever you are in the UK.\n\n• Driver tracking - see the name and a picture of your driver or why not track their location and find out where you are in the delivery queue. See your driver's estimated arrival time so you know when to expect your parcel.\n\n• In flight options - when we’re on our way to you, if your plans change you can still rearrange your delivery right up until we deliver your parcel. You can instruct our driver to deliver on a different day, to a preferred neighbour, to a safe place or even to one of our 2,500 DPD Pickup shops.\n\n• Pickup shops - if you’re collecting your parcel from a nearby DPD Pickup shop, get opening hours, your pickup pass for collection and directions from your delivery address.\n\n***Existing users Please note: Thinking of deleting our app?

Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html",

We only have the capacity to verify 100,000 people for Thursday Version 1.0 however we are working hard to be able to add more members quickly.\n\nThe dating app that shows you who wants to go on a date that day. Every Thursday, the app comes to life with people near you who also want to meet that day.\n\nMISSION\n\nTo make Thursday the most exciting day to be single, every week.\n\nWHY\n\nIt’s a fact: people are spending too much time on dating apps. Not only is the whole experience underwhelming, but pressure to find ‘the one’ is boring. When did being single become a thing to be ashamed of? That’s where Thursday comes in. We built an app where everything you want from online dating happens in one day, making Thursday the one day of the week when singles can match, chat and meet. Why? Because there’s more to life than dating apps.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to send unlimited likes, get boosted or unlock an additional day can upgrade to a VIP Membership.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\n\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period.
