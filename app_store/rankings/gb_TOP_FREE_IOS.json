You simply have to enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After, you'll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication for work, school, and non-Microsoft accounts. The app provides a second layer of security after your password. When logging in, you'll enter your password, and then you'll be asked for an additional way to prove it's really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the verification code generated by the app.  \n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.",

    "description": "Classroom is a free service for schools, non-profits and anyone with a personal Google Account. Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect – inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate and stay organised.\n \n Classroom is designed to help teachers create, collect and mark assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organised.\n \n Students can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and marks right in Classroom.\n \n With the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them right from their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has handed in work and mark the assignment – at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n \n There are many benefits of using Classroom:\n \n Easy to set up\n Teachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n \n Saves time\n The simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review and mark assignments quickly, all in one place.\n \n Improves organisation\n Students can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, and all class materials (e.g. documents, photos and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n \n Enhances communication\n Classroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with each other or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n \n Secure\n Like the rest of Google Workspace for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes.\n \n Permissions notice:\n Camera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\n Microphone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\n Photos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom.",

    "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

    "description": "With 30 billion matches to date, Tinder® is the world’s most popular app for meeting new people. Think of us as your most dependable wingmate — wherever you go, we’ll be there. If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, come on over.\n\nMORE FEATURES? THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you. Think of it as your personal Tinder concierge — available 24/7 — bringing all of your pending matches to you. Now you can sit back, enjoy a fine cocktail and browse through profiles in your own time. Goodbye search fatigue.

    "description": "Circuit Laundry App\n\nUse our latest smart-scan technology - and pay for your laundry with your phone.\n\nMake doing the laundry less of a hassle with a mobile app that's as easy-to-use as our washing machines and dryers! The Circuit Laundry app lets you top up your Circuit app account* in seconds, and then you're good to go...just turn up at your nearest Circuit launderette, load your laundry, scan a machine's QR code and select the programme you want to start - job done! Your credit will be adjusted automatically so you'll always have your circuit account balance to hand. No need to stay and watch your washing.\n\nOnce the washer or dryer gets going the app also gives you a countdown** that tells you how long there is to go until your laundry is done.\n\n* Please note that your Circuit app account is separate to your laundry card account you access from the Circuit website. If you haven’t used the Circuit app before you will need to sign up separately on the app. Balances from your laundry card cannot be transferred to your Circuit app account and vice versa.\n\n**The app will rely on your phone having a wi-fi, 3G or 4G signal inside the laundry room to activate the machines - and also to see the countdown on the cycle if you leave to do something else while your wash completes. As long as you're connected, you can see how long is left on your chosen cycle and get on with other things instead of waiting in the launderette.\n\nBy downloading this app, you agree to the following T&C's:\n\nYou accept that you have a non-exclusive licence to use the app. You agree not to copy the app or infringe our intellectual property rights in the app.\n\nThe minimum amount of top-up credit you can buy is £5.00. Your payment will be processed through PayPal and Circuit will not hold any card details.\n\nYou can apply for a refund of part-used top-up credit by emailing us at apprefund@circuit.co.uk with details of registered email address, the date of the in-App purchase, the amount of credit purchased, and the amount of credit to be refunded. No refund will be given on balances of less than £5.00. Refunds will incur an administration charge of £3.00, which will be deducted directly from the refund value. Refunds will be made using the payment method used for the purchase. No refund will be processed for any free credit. Unused credits will expire 12 months after the date of purchase. Please see our website www.circuit.co.uk for more information.",
