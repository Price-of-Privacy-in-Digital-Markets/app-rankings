    "description": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏",

    "description": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use Automatic Recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"My new absolute favourite app - #Chirpomatic (It's basically Shazam for birds!!)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with iSpiny in any way.",

    "description": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Game entirely in English.\n\n#MadeWithFusion",

    "description": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation.",

    "description": "The original and the best, accept no cheap imitations ! \nRecord a bird singing and use Automatic Recognition to help identify it. Unlike all other apps, no internet or mobile connection is needed.\n\n•   The Times Newspaper said the app \"Does what it says on the \n\ntin\" and were amazed that \"this astonishing piece of software \ncosts about the same as a cup of coffee\".\n\n•   \"In direct comparison Bird Song Id showed better results than Chirpomatic\". - naturschutz.ch - Swiss Birding Magazine \n\nCopied by a few, bettered by none, Bird Song Id is three years  \nahead of anyone else in this field !\n\n•   The Telegraph Newspaper said \"Bird Song Id is a good walk improved, and may even put a spring in your step\".\n\n•   over 1000 good ratings\n\nAutomatic Recognition takes place on the device, no connection to the internet or mobile network is needed.\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs good quality recordings to work. See the HELP below, or follow the Developer Website link to find out how to improve your recordings.\n\nAutomatic Recognition will help identify a good cross section of bird song in the British Isles, but you will need a good quality recording. Lots of blue and green peaks reaching to the top of the analysis graph is a good indication of a quality recording. Help and examples are included in the app to guide you.\n\nHow successful is it ? Our aim is to get the correct bird in the top three of those listed. In our testing of over 1,000 samples we found the success rate to be 85%.\n\nFollow the Developer Website link to see a demo of Automatic Recognition on YouTube\n\n--------------- HELP ----------------\n\nAutomatic Recognition needs a good quality recording of the bird.\n-------------\nOnly record when a single bird is singing, or when a single bird is dominant\n-------------\nThe analysis graph should have plenty of blue and green colors with few or no black peaks.\n-------------\nThe peaks on the graph should reach all the way to the top. Low peaks indicate poor quality and recognition is unlikely.\n-------------\nThe Audio Quality, shown at the top of the results screen, should be at least Good, and preferably Very Good or Excellent\n-------------\nThe highest score should be above 70% to be useful. Below this and the system is telling you it is not sure what the song is.\n-------------\nA difference between two birds of less than 10% is not that significant, so listen to the samples from both to help you further\n-------------\nSee the samples for how the analysis graph should look (to see the samples press the sample button at the top right of the help page)\n-------------\nMake sure it is very quiet apart from the bird song which should be nice and loud\n-------------\nBe as close to the bird as you can be without disturbing it\n-------------\nBe patient, dont expect miracles, the system works but needs good clear recordings\n-------------\nThe microphone is at the bottom of an iPhone, point the bottom of the phone towards the bird\n-------------\nRemove the case from your iPhone if you use one as this can dampen the microphone\n-------------\nRecord a single bird at a time\n-------------\nCapture at least two singing episodes if you can. \n-------------\nRecord for the full 30 seconds\n-------------\nAvoid windy conditions. Air moving over the microphone will mask the bird sounds\n-------------\nMake sure there is plenty of life in the battery. Your device will reduce power going to the microphone as the battery runs down\n-------------\nPlaying songs to the app from recorded material on the internet, other apps or CDs is unlikely to work as this material is digitally processed and edited (inter phase gaps are often shortened). They sound very different to recording birds for real on an iPhone or iPad in the natural environment. Its a bit like putting rocket fuel in a lawn mower.\n-------------",

    "description": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. \n\n\"It took some time and patience... but I found it... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the UK and 101 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's heartbeat and other sounds - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first but you can really hear the heart beat! Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's sounds and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nIt takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it.\n\nWhen you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with HMB and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your baby heartbeat.\n\n**** Works Beautifully From 27 Weeks ****\nIt is possible (but less likely) to hear from as early as 16-20 weeks, best results are most often achieved as the baby gets larger.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best results\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for HMB to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive in the heartbeat range.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\nX, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - we wouldn't wish to claim otherwise. Under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong with your baby :)- Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA or any other medical authority. This is not a medical device. \n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp",

    "description": "\"Laminitis\" the iPhone App was created to provide horse owners with a practical tool to help monitor weather conditions in a way that can be used to warn when grazing on grass posses an increased risk to horses prone to laminitis.\n\nLocal weather conditions are monitored and are used to predict the rise and fall of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC's) in grass.  When the predicted NSC's increase, this is shown as a rise in risk.\n\nUnder extreme weather conditions grass can become stressed and in these circumstances significantly increase the risk of a horse becoming footy or suffering a laminitic episode.  When this type of weather pattern happens the risk gauge will rapidly increase to High and maintain this level until the NSC and grass stress levels are predicted to have lowered again.\n\nToday, laminitis is a huge problem for horses all over the world and is one of the most common causes of lameness.  With the help of this app as an educational tool it is hoped that fewer horses will suffer from this condition going forward.\n\nCurrent Coverage: United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales & Northern Ireland), Ireland, France, Belgium\n\nDISCLAIMER\nThis application is not intended as a replacement for correct animal husbandry or to replace veterinary advice, it's role is simply to act as an additional early warning tool to advise when grasses at the location you have selected are likely to be 'under stress' and therefore to have accumulated excess non-structural carbohydrates (NSC, i.e. sugars, starch or fructan) which could significantly increase the risk of a laminitic episode should it be grazed.\n\nThis app can give you a warning when the risk of grazing induced laminitis is rising or high. However, individual horses vary widely in their ability to tolerate fluctuations in NSC levels so what is safe for one horse may not be safe for another. In addition, grazing is only one risk factor for laminitis and you need also to be aware of the risks posed by other causes, including toxins, metabolic problems and sugar and starch levels in hard feed, which cannot be measured by this app.",

    "description": "Featured in LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\n\nDa Vinci Eye is the #1 essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

    "description": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!\n\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift).

    "description": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved",

    "description": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.",

The Isle of Man is included only at 1:250,000 (free) and 1:50,000 (paid).\n\nSince 2010, Britain's national mapping agency Ordnance Survey has released a large amount of free map data.  UK Map makes much of that data available in a single app. It includes 1:1M MiniScale® and 1:250k road maps, which are built into the app, and 1:25k district maps and 1:10k street maps for the entire country which you can download in 5km by 5km tiles.  As the free O.S. data does not include footpaths, this app superimposes footpaths derived from volunteer-collected data from OpenStreetMap.org.  These downloads are free of charge.\n\nIn addition to the free maps, you can also purchase and download 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 maps that are just like the Ordnance Survey paper maps.  You can also purchase 1:10,000 maps for selected urban areas which show more detail than the free 1:10,000 maps.\n\nOnce you've downloaded the detailed maps that you need, an internet connection is not required.\n\nThe app can load GPX files (for example, from websites, other apps and from nearby devices via AirDrop) and display waypoints, tracks and routes.  You can also mark waypoints, plan routes and record tracks within the app, and export them.\n\nYou can view graphs of altitude or speed along recorded tracks and routes.\n\nThe app has a 3D mode that lets you view the terrain from any viewpoint, useful for visualising hills and mountains.\n\nThe app also includes a searchable gazetteer containing over 250,000 place names, 850,000 street names and 1.6 million post codes. All of this data is built in to the app, so this search also works when there is no network connection.\n\nThe app also supports the compass and GPS - on those devices that have them - to display your position, orientation and altitude.\n\nPaid maps are licensed for personal and non-commercial use only.\n\nContains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database rights 2011 - 2019.

    "description": "Shift Worker is designed for people who need a quick and easy way to enter and view their shifts.\n\nA traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!",

When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game. \n\nDISCLAIMER\nGoat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n* You can be a goat \n* Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat \n* MILLIONS OF BUGS!

    "description": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (UK/US), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly.",

    "description": "Hit the Button Maths is an app designed to help develop mental maths and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout the primary school age range. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered:\n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12\n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers \n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game.",

    "description": "Klimper is a mobile music studio with built-in music theory to spark your creativity and speed up your workflow.\n\n\nFind Chords that Work\n\nIn the chord palette your can explore chords that are available in your selected scale. While a chord is played, related chords are highlighted so you can easily find chord sequences that progress smoothly. Once you found a nice chord sequence, you can drag and drop chords into your song to build your composition upon it.\nIf you want to start your song with a melody and find a suitable chord progression, you can do that just as well: select notes and tap the search icon to show chords that match your melody fragment. It's real fun to experiment, seeing how different harmonic contexts affect the perception of the same melodic fragment.\n\n\nCreate Beautiful Melodies and Flowing Chord Progressions\n\nIn the piano roll, notes that are in harmony as well as the chords' root notes are highlighted. This makes it super easy to create leads, arpeggios and basslines and to experiment with different chord voicings to let your chord progressions flowing nicely. \n\n\nIntuitive Editing\n\nA simple, yet feature rich and context-aware user interface helps you build up your ideas into whole songs:\nGroup sections into song parts and arrange them via drag and drop. \nDuplicate, copy and paste, playback selected notes.\n\n\nFile Export\n\nExport and share your creations with audio file export.\nEdit your song in other Apps with MIDI-file export.\n\n\nUse your Favorite Instrument Apps\n\nIt's just more fun to explore and create with those awesome Instrument Apps that are available in the App Store: Klimper supports Inter-App-Audio Instruments like Animoog and Model 15 as well as Audio Unit Instruments like Ripplemaker and Mersenne.\n\n\nVideo Tutorials\n\nThe included tutorial will help you getting started.

    "description": "Pure Piano is a professional, multi-sampled concert grand piano with a unique Morph Pad that allows you to explore a multitude of sounds ranging from mellow and intimate tones to surreal, cinematic textures. \n\nSimilar to an XY pad in its flat, tactile nature, the Morph Pad offers up nine different core timbres of the piano including percussive, cinematic, bright, and intimate, to name a few. The “pure” piano sits untouched at the heart and center of the space, surrounded by eight more presets for you to explore as you guide your finger seamlessly through the wide-ranging tonal palette of the piano. As you do so, the various timbres blend together allowing you to create your own sounds comprising combinations of neighboring presets for you to save and recall. It doesn’t stop there either. The Morph Pad is linked to the app’s inbuilt EQ, reverb, and delay and so operates as a macro control adding even more to the experience by way of ever-changing texture and atmosphere, all from just one single piano. \n\nPure Piano works as a standalone app or as an AUv3 plug-in within your DAW of choice, and extensive connectivity options allow you to connect to your keyboard controller with ease via USB, direct, or Bluetooth MIDI to experience the sound of a professional grand piano through your headphones or speakers. The app also supports direct connection to your Mac using Inter Device Audio (IDAM). This enables you to easily integrate Pure Piano into your desktop projects by sending MIDI and receiving audio with one single cable, as well as network MIDI and Inter-App Audio for triggering the piano from other apps that you might have installed.   \n\nEquipped with customizable reverb, EQ, and delay, sound creation becomes even more creative. Simply unlink any of the audio effects from the Morph Pad to dial in your own settings. Maybe you want to add a long reverb tail to add some extra atmosphere, tweak the EQ a little or add some delay to a particular sound. It’s up to you. \n\nIf all that isn’t enough, there’s a host of flexible tuning options for when you need them. The stretched, concert piano tuning is how a piano technician would tune the piano for concerts in order to achieve rich tonal chord textures across the entire range. The equal temperament tuning on the other hand is the standard western tuning scheme, best for when layering Pure Piano with other sounds like electric pianos, pads or strings. Also provided is the ability to transpose the piano up or down in either semi-tones or Hz for fine-tune adjustments. \n\nPure Piano is designed and developed by Hamburg-based e-instruments, renowned for their high-end digital recreations of acoustic instruments. \n\nFeature Overview: \n• Interactive Morph Pad - Explore the many timbres of a concert grand\n\n• Nine different sounds - Navigate and blend between nine core sounds\n\n• Studio Quality Audio at Ultra-low Latency\n\n• Extensive Connectivity - Connect via USB, direct, or Bluetooth MIDI. Inter Device Audio (IDAM), Network MIDI, and Inter-App Audio also fully supported\n\n• Standalone and AUv3 plug-in compatible - Plug and play or use within your favourite music production software\n\n• Zynaptiq QREV Reverb - Have fun adding extra atmosphere and depth to your sound\n\n• 3-Band EQ and Delay - Get creative with customizable EQ and Delay, or use the Morph Pad as a macro control\n\n• Save and Load Your Own Presets - Wherever you land on the Morph Pad, if you like the sound you hear – save it and recall it again later\n\n• Flexible Tuning Options - Choose between equal or stretched tuning, and transpose the piano by semitones or Hz\n\n• Customizable velocity curve - Match the response of your keyboard to Pure Piano\n\n• 24-bit, 44.1 kHz\n\n• Requires iOS 13 or above\n\n• 1.1GB installation",

    "description": "The low FODMAP diet app has been developed in partnership with medical experts and dietitians from Kings College and Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. The app enables you to search for suitable packaged UK foods when following the low FODMAP diet. \n\nDietary triggers are difficult to identify but research has shown that some carbohydrates (FODMAPs) may contribute to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Restricting FODMAP intake has been shown to improve these symptoms caused by ibs food intolerance but this may not apply to everyone. The low FODMAP diet has been shown to be effective in managing IBS symptoms in up to 70% of people. \n\nUsing the app you will be able to manage all three stages of the low fodmap ibs diet to create a FODMAP plan, search and scan barcodes to find FODMAP friendly foods. Improve your chances of successfully following the low FODMAP diet and then re-introducing foods to understand the ingredients that are triggering your symptoms.\n\nKey features:\n•\tScan barcodes to check FODMAP friendly foods\n•\tSearch quickly and easily for everyday FODAMP diet foods\n•\tShare your re-introduction charts with your clinician/dietitian\n•\tQuick FODMAP food check and guidance on portion sizes\n•\tRegularly updated tips & tricks from the dietitian\n•\tCreate your own personalised FODMAP profile \n•\tAt each stage track and record your symptoms\n•\tFull product ingredient and nutrition facts from food label\n•\tCreate your own personalised shopping lists\n\nThe app should be used in consultation with a healthcare professional.\n\nPlease note:\n\n• Due to the highly personalised nature of using this app you are required to create a user account in order to use the search filters, try a food challenge or custom filters during the trial period.\n• Cancellation of the current subscription is not allowed during any active subscription period. \n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. \n• Terms apply see http://www.foodmaestro.me/terms\n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please go to http://www.foodmaestro.me/privacy\n\nWARNING: This application and the information that it contains do NOT constitute medical advice and should NOT serve as the basis for any medical decision by you or anyone else.

He suddenly loses consciousness and comes to in what appears to be the interior of the academy.\nThe dreary mood is far from the impression given by the name \"Hope's Peak Academy.\" The dingy corridors, iron-barred windows, and prison-like atmosphere... Something is wrong.\n\nIn the entrance hall, a stuffed bear that claims to be the headmaster tells the students they will live in the confines of the school until the day they die, and they must kill someone if they want to leave.\n\nIncluding Makoto, there are 15 Ultimate Students from all over the world trapped in this academy of despair.\nOne thing after another crushes their hope. Incidents which shake their trust, the sadistic headmaster, and the mystery of the mastermind.

It is recalling the images you took 72 hours later, when 80% of your memory has blurred and faded away, will turn your short-term memory into long-term memory. Our team also has attempted to reproduce the in-the-moment experience of taking photos by eliminating the Instant Review feature found on conventional digital cameras and reducing 95 % of the conventional viewfinder feature, leaving only the bare minimum needed for taking shots.\n\n\"Gudak-dari Camera\", as its name suggests, refers to a time-worn and antique camera. Living in a digital generation where \"Un-do\" function is prevalent, we may have lost\n\nthe thrill of making new and conscious decisions. \"Patients is a virtue\" has faded its original value and people are getting used to selecting one palatable photo out of a myriad of photos. Amid this so-called \"digitalization\", we hope you to recall the thrill of making new choices by seizing the \"Gudak Moment\".\n\nGudak 3.2 Update has added a self-camera feature that allows you to shoot with a front camera as Gudak feels.\nExperience a new look of Gudak and a variety of emotional photos with front cameras as well as rear cameras. The theme will be updated further in the future.\n\n*The Lecoq film is only available in Korea.\n\nAlso, for those who feel that Gudak photos are dark, you can adjust the brightness of photos through the newly added ISO (based on world standard film sensitivity).\n\nA Gudakbook icon has been added to make Gudak photos a real album. Try to experience the feeling of those days through Gudakbook like the excitement I felt when printing the film camera. You can apply for Gudakbook through the print icon on the Printed Envelope Check page.\n\n\n[Explanation of Authority ]\n\nEssential access authority\n- Cameras: Camera access for photography\n- Save: External Storage Read/Write permissions for photoshooting, storing, and bringing in\n\nSelective access\n* You can use the service without agreeing to access rights.\n- Location: Location access to tag location information in pictures",

You can also directly sync with the No.1 snoring tracking app - SnoreLab - to track your progress.\n\nOne of the main causes of snoring is weak muscles in the mouth area. SnoreGym is an exercise app which helps to tone your upper airway muscles to reduce snoring.\n\nSnoreGym will guide you through a set of clinically-proven exercises for your tongue, soft palate, cheeks and jaw.\n\nFeatures include:\n- Exercises to reduce snoring\n- Easy-to-follow animations\n- Clear and detailed instructions\n- Evidence-based workouts\n- Progress tracking\n- Sync to SnoreLab\n\nScientists have tested a set of mouth exercises which tone muscles in the tongue, soft palate, throat, cheeks and jaw. This research has shown that mouth exercises can reduce snoring, decrease the severity of sleep apnea, reduce disturbance of bed partners and produce better sleep and quality of life.\n\nIt is important to do these exercises regularly to reduce your snoring. We recommend at least 10 minutes a day for 8+ weeks.\n\nExercise now for quieter sleep!",

    "description": "As seen on Alexander Armstrong's phone on the BBC's Michael McIntyre's Big Show\n\nSimon Mayo, radio presenter: \"Great app... Everyone loves it...  Can I request a Bittern?\"\n\nChosen by Apple for \"Apps for the Great Outdoors\"\n\n\"Identifying a bird by its song is fun and satisfying and this app is a great help\" - The Telegraph, 500 Must-Have Apps\n\n\"Equal parts wildlife guide and feel-good pick-me-up\" - The Guardian, \"Top 10 Green Apps\"\n\nChirp! includes more British birds than any other bird song ID app, and includes special features such as a ‘human translation’, to tell you what the bird is actually saying.\n\nThe identification and learning of bird songs can be hard, but not with Chirp!. A short description and helpful tips are given for each song or call, as well as a photo of each bird. Birds can be sorted by commonness, so you can listen to the most common ones first, then move on to rarer species. Or sort by song style, so that you can compare birds that hoot and coo, or those with high pitched songs for example. You can also sort by name, habitat or bird group.\n\nAfter listening, try the quiz to test your memory. Answer fast to earn a score multiplier and get on the high score table. Experienced birders can use the custom quiz to help distinguish and learn similar songs. \n\nThe slideshow section can be used as a way to relax, or switch the voiceover on and see if you can say the name of the bird before the voiceover. This is a good way of competing with the family - who can say the name of the bird first?! \n\nIncludes birds from Britain, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Spain, Portugal and Italy. \n\n========= Our bird song apps =========\n\nWe have been making bird song apps since the App Store started in 2008, and now have a range of bird and bird song apps for iOS devices - iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad & Apple Watch.\n\n--------------- Chirp! ---------------\nChirp!, described above, is our original and most popular app. The first birdsong ID app, it has been in the the top selling charts every day since it was launched over seven years ago. It has changed considerably in that time as it has grown in size and features.\n\nChirp! is specifically designed to help you identify and learn birdsongs. However, it is also great if you just want to chill out to the sounds of nature.\n\n\n----------- ChirpOMatic -----------\nFor automatic (shazam-style) birdsong ID, you need our ChirpOMatic app. \n\nChirpOMatic is our newest app. Already the top bird song ID app (in our opinion!), we are very actively developing ChirpOMatic and improving it with every update.\n\nAs simple to use as the well-known Shazam app for music, when you hear a bird singing, just point your iPhone, iPad or iPod towards the sound, and tap the button to record. After 12 seconds the recording will stop and you will be shown the top matches.\n\n\n---- ChirpOMatic & Chirp! bundle ----\nThe 2 bird song ID apps are available as a bargain bundle. They work together - once you have the identification of a bird in ChirpOMatic, you can tap straight through to the same bird in Chirp!\n\n\n---- Bird Guide Pro & Pocket Birds ----\nThese are our full bird guides, with photos, sounds, notes etc, plus features for recording sightings. Bird Guide Pro is our top-of-the-range app, while Pocket Birds is the budget version.\n\n\n========= About us =========\n\nTo keep up with the latest news or to get in touch:\nTwitter: twitter.com/iSpiny\nFacebook: www.facebook.com/chirpbirdsongs\nEmail: spiny@ispiny.com\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with iSpiny in any way.",

    "description": "The most advanced sports timer in the AppStore! \nFeatured by Apple in the TV-ad \"Strength\". \n\nSprintTimer is a unique sports timer and photo finish app that employs the same techniques as the fully automatic timing equipment (FAT) used at the Olympics. Start the timer and point the camera towards the finish line. The app creates an image where you can scroll to get the time for each competitor with a 0.01 s accuracy*. SprintTimer also includes a motion-activated Video Finish for longer races and a Start Sender for wirelessly controlling SprintTimer from another device.\n\nSprintTimer is used by coaches, teachers, and athletes all over the world for practice and competition in, for example, track & field, cycling, skiing, speed skating, car racing, rowing, kayaking, horses or greyhound racing. \n\nSprintTimer has several advantages over a manual stopwatch: \n- One person can time all participants\n- Higher accuracy*\n- Easier to determine the order\n- The image and the results can be saved\n- Can operate \"hands-free\" when started\n- The timer can be started manually, with a sound, or remotely from another device\n\n*sprinttimer.app/accuracy\n\n——— Reviews and Comments ———\n\n\"Without a doubt the best App available on the market for sprinters and coaches who want accurate timing to see their development.\"\nspeedendurance.com\n\n\"AMAZING\"\nthepegeek.com\n\n\"Amazing app for physical education teachers or coaches!

Highly recommended.\n- This app is wonderful. We use it to time all our meets.\n- This is a great app and it is getting better from release to release\n- Nice, nice, nice! Using it for our youth track team. Love it! 5 stars!\n- Exactly what I needed - Fantastic app\n- Thank you so much for developing this amazing app just when we ran out of options.\n- Congratulations on developing a really clever and useful app.\n- Love what you did with the SprintTimer app.\n\n——— In-App Purchases and Subscriptions ———\n\nThe Start Sender and Results Manager features require the purchase of SprintTimer Pro, available as a subscription at $4.99 per year.

Easily share crafts and saved games with the community. Included are 17 different challenges to put your creations to the test.\n\nBuild crafts by snapping parts together. Choose from the pre-built engines, such as the Mage, which is a powerful kerosene-fueled engine. Or choose the very weak, but highly efficient Ion Engine. Or you can dig deeper into the complexity of rocket science and design your own rocket engines. Choose from the eight available engine types, seven nozzles, and six fuel types. From there you can change engine size, nozzle length, throat radius, and more.\n\nUse interstages to split your craft into multiple stages and piece together modular fairings to protect your precious cargo. Launch multiple crafts into orbit. You can dock with your existing crafts to build space stations, moon bases, refueling stations, etc. \n\nResize and reshape fuel tanks, wings, cargo bays, fairings, and nose cones with easy-to-use tools that help you create exactly what you want. Resize solar panels, wheels, pistons, shocks, etc to fit your needs. Paint your craft custom colors and tweak their reflectiveness, emissiveness, and texture styles.\n\nOrbits are realistically simulated and support time-warp so you don't have to wait several months to reach another planet. The Map View makes it easy to see your orbits and plan future burns, which you can use to set up future encounters with other planets or satellites.\n\nThe flight model dynamically updates drag and lift characteristics of your craft as it changes. Re-entry effects kick in when you're screaming through an atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. Be careful, because the excessive heat can cause those aforementioned rapid unplanned disassemblies.\n\n\nDownload from a huge collection of user-uploaded crafts and sandboxes on our website. Upload your own crafts and sandboxes and share them with the community. Rise through the ranks from a white level builder to a gold level builder and beyond.\n\nFEATURES\n\n* Fully 3D Rocket Designer that allows building anything from basic rockets to very complicated multi-stage rockets, airplanes, rovers, satellites, robotic mechs, etc.\n* Design custom rocket engines and jet engines\n* Realistic rocket physics and orbital mechanics.\n* Over 30 parts, including fairings, retractable solar panels, rover wheels, engines, etc. \n* Highly procedural parts that can be resized and reshaped into endless combinations, such as the resizable fuel tank and the cargo bay.\n* Map View to navigate the solar system that displays predicted orbits and encounters. \n* Fully 3D, rotating planets that support water and multiple biomes, such as desert, grasslands, tundra, etc.\n* Persistent sandbox that retains your previous launches.\n* Players can upload their rockets and sandboxes and share them with other players. \n* Online community where players can upvote and comment on other players' content.\n* Several build and flight challenges.\n* Parts support textures, reflections, and custom coloring.\n* Flight model dynamically updates drag and lift characteristics of your craft as it changes.\n* Re-entry effects including visual effects and part damage from heat.\n* Custom Launch Locations allow launching from multiple places in the solar system.\n* Support for saving custom subassemblies.\n* Crafts can dock together in orbit and transfer fuel.\n* Built-in tutorials show you how to build a craft and how to achieve orbit.\n* Time-Warp allows fast-forwarding while in orbit.",
