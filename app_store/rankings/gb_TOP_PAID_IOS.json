    "description": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏",

    "description": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

    "description": "Featured in LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\nDa Vinci Eye is the #1 essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

    "description": "Hit the Button Maths is an app designed to help develop mental maths and calculation skills.\n\nThe app is aimed at 5-11 year olds. There are 166 different game modes of varying difficulty so it is useful throughout the primary school age range. Answer as many questions as possible in minute-long games, or you can now practice without the pressure of a countdown timer - a feature which is new for 2019. Questions are randomly generated which means it is very replayable. The game has been carefully designed for children, with large, widely spaced buttons. We recommend that young children play on a tablet.\n\nSix main topics are covered:\n\n* Times tables - up to 10 or 12\n* Division - up to 10 or 12\n* Square numbers \n* Number bonds\n* Doubling \n* Halving\n\nBetween these topics, the four standard arithmetic operations are covered: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.\n\nYou can create up to 30 player profiles per device to track an individual's high scores (increased from 15 in 2019). If you prefer there's also the option to play as a guest. All data is stored locally on your device so you don't have to worry about privacy issues. We've also made it very easy for children to quickly switch between profiles after playing a game, if they're sharing a device.\n\nAfter each game, the score achieved is displayed along with the child's high score. Bronze, silver or gold stars and trophies are awarded depending on the score achieved in each game.",

Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance.",

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. For this reason, please familiarize yourself with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nAside from the cloud synchronization service, AnkiMobile also supports copying decks to and from your device via the USB cable and iTunes.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: http://ankisrs.net/docs/AnkiMobile.html\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning.\n\nEven if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.\n\nIf you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher.

    "description": "Dark Sky is the most accurate source of hyperlocal weather information. With down-to-the-minute forecasts, you’ll know exactly when the rain will start or stop, right where you’re standing. (It’s like magic.) \n\nFeatured in: New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Fast Company, Wired, and more.\n\nYOUR WEATHER, DOWN TO THE MINUTE \nDark Sky is able to create forecasts for your precise location, giving you minute-by-minute predictions for the next hour and hour-by-hour forecasts for the next day and week.\n\nBEAUTIFUL WEATHER ANIMATIONS \nThe same technology that powers Dark Sky’s predictions also allows us to make the world’s first perfectly smooth radar animation. Other apps show you a chunky slideshow that makes it nearly impossible to tell how storms are moving. But Dark Sky’s radar animation lets you see the actual path of the storm: how it moved in the past, and where it’s going in the future. \n\nPUSH NOTIFICATIONS \nDark Sky comes with advanced notification options: Receive down-to-the-minute alerts before it starts raining at your exact location, get notified of government severe weather alerts (for such things as thunderstorms, flooding, hurricanes, etc.), or even create your own custom notifications covering the next 24 hours for things like temperature, wind, precipitation and more. Even if you haven’t opened the app in days, Dark Sky will tell you what you need to know, when you need to know it. \n\nTODAY WIDGET\nThe Dark Sky Notification Center Widget tells you at a glance what’s going to happen in the next hour and the next week, so you don’t even have to unlock your phone to quickly check the weather before heading out.\n\nTIME MACHINE\nExplore weather in the past or future. Choose a date and see historical weather data or future predictions based off of seasonal averages.\n\nAPPLE WATCH\nDark Sky looks great on your wrist. Get notifications and check out the weather for the next week with the Dark Sky app built from scratch for Apple Watch.",

    "description": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Game entirely in English.\n\n#MadeWithFusion",

    "description": "Drive your car through a zombie apocalypse in this massive follow-up to the chart-topping hit Earn to Die!\n\nAn evacuation ship is waiting on the other side of the country. The only thing that stands in your way: city after city overrun by zombies . With only a run-down car and a small amount of cash you face a familiar situation... to drive through hordes of zombies in order to survive!\n\nBRAND NEW STORY MODE\nEarn to Die 2 introduces a massive new Story Mode, five times longer than its predecessor. The game departs its familiar desert setting and delves into the depths of cities infested by zombies. \n\nMULTI-TIERED LEVELS:\nLevels are now multi-tiered! Drive across decayed highway overpasses, via underground tunnels, or smash through epic zombie filled factories. Whichever path you choose to take, you won't be able to escape the zombie hordes - your only choice is to smash through them!\n\nBUILD A ZOMBIE-SLAUGHTERING MACHINE\nUnlock and upgrade 10 different vehicles, including a sports car, a fire truck, and even an ice-cream van. Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.\n\nDESTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES\nVehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.\n\nMORE ZOMBIES. MORE DESTRUCTION. MORE MAYHEM.\nWhat are you waiting for? That rescue ship isn't going to wait forever! Prepare yourself for a wild ride - and seriously, there is nothing like smashing through zombie-filled factories!",

    "description": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. \n\n\"It took some time and patience... but I found it... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the UK and 101 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's heartbeat and other sounds - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first but you can really hear the heart beat! Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's sounds and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nIt takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it.\n\nWhen you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with HMB and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your baby heartbeat.\n\n**** Works Beautifully From 27 Weeks ****\nIt is possible (but less likely) to hear from as early as 16-20 weeks, best results are most often achieved as the baby gets larger.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best results\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for HMB to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive in the heartbeat range.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\nX, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - we wouldn't wish to claim otherwise. Under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong with your baby :)- Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA or any other medical authority. This is not a medical device. \n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp",

    "description": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

    "description": "The low FODMAP diet app has been developed in partnership with medical experts and dietitians from Kings College and Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust. The app enables you to search for suitable packaged UK foods when following the low FODMAP diet. \n\nDietary triggers are difficult to identify but research has shown that some carbohydrates (FODMAPs) may contribute to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Restricting FODMAP intake has been shown to improve these symptoms caused by ibs food intolerance but this may not apply to everyone. The low FODMAP diet has been shown to be effective in managing IBS symptoms in up to 70% of people. \n\nUsing the app you will be able to manage all three stages of the low fodmap ibs diet to create a FODMAP plan, search and scan barcodes to find FODMAP friendly foods. Improve your chances of successfully following the low FODMAP diet and then re-introducing foods to understand the ingredients that are triggering your symptoms.\n\nKey features:\n•\tScan barcodes to check FODMAP friendly foods\n•\tSearch quickly and easily for everyday FODAMP diet foods\n•\tShare your re-introduction charts with your clinician/dietitian\n•\tQuick FODMAP food check and guidance on portion sizes\n•\tRegularly updated tips & tricks from the dietitian\n•\tCreate your own personalised FODMAP profile \n•\tAt each stage track and record your symptoms\n•\tFull product ingredient and nutrition facts from food label\n•\tCreate your own personalised shopping lists\n\nThe app should be used in consultation with a healthcare professional.\n\nPlease note:\n\n• Due to the highly personalised nature of using this app you are required to create a user account in order to use the search filters, try a food challenge or custom filters during the trial period.\n• Cancellation of the current subscription is not allowed during any active subscription period. \n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period. \n• Terms apply see http://www.foodmaestro.me/terms\n\nFor more information on our privacy policy please go to http://www.foodmaestro.me/privacy\n\nWARNING: This application and the information that it contains do NOT constitute medical advice and should NOT serve as the basis for any medical decision by you or anyone else.

They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.\n\n#MadeWithFusion",

    "description": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation.",

The app also features supporting tools including an interval trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit.",

Fazbear Entertainment provides its franchisees with all the tools and knowledge necessary to create and manage a welcoming, secure and profitable location.\n\nOh and if you feel up to it, try to salvage some of the animatronics that wander outside your restaurant. They are trying to get in for months now, better not miss on the opportunity to pick up spare parts and rake in some additional revenue. If you detect any instability or aggressiveness in any of them, use the self-defense taser that Fazbear Entertainment provides free of charge to all of its franchisees.\n\nThis puts an end to the assistance that we are legally obligated to provide.

I'm always sceptical about spending money on apps but this one is so worth it.  ******\n\nI have used many meditation apps but like this one best because it offers a variety of guided meditations to use in different situations or for different purposes. They vary in the amount of time required so the app is very flexible. I also like the stats which encourage you to practice regularly. Plus I can add meditation that I do outside of the app and track that too.

    "description": "Shift Worker is designed for people who need a quick and easy way to enter and view their shifts.\n\nA traditional calendar is not always ideal for shift workers. Sometimes it's not easy to see your upcoming shift schedule very clearly, especially if your shifts don't fall into the traditional working week. Shift Worker solves this problem and turns the frustrating task of entry into a quick and easy experience.\n\nShift Worker allows you to create your own types of shifts by combining visually-attractive icons with letters/numbers so that they can be easily identified at a glance. By including a range of icons (such as suns and stars for day and night shifts) in a variety of colors, any combination is possible for all types of shifts.\n\nEntering shifts can be done quickly by simply selecting a type of shift and tapping on each date it occurs. An entire month of shifts could be entered in seconds, an entire year in a few minutes!\n\nIn addition, Shift Worker allows you create multiple calendars to see friends and family shifts! You can send your shifts to others so they can also see your shifts at a glance as an image or in their copy of Shift Worker. To make things even simpler, you can even save your shifts to your iPhone/iPod's background so that referring to your upcoming shift schedule is as simple as picking up your iPhone/iPod. \n\nShift Worker also includes the ability to create colored personalized notes for each date. Notes can be used anytime additional information needs to be added to a date.\n\nFEATURES:\n\n- Create a virtually unlimited amount of shift types\n- Enter shifts on the calendar months in advance in seconds\n- Add your rotation and automatically fill the calendar in a few simple steps\n- Show friends and family shifts using multiple calendars\n- View the calendar in timeline format to see your shift flow at a glance\n- Create colored personalized notes for any date on the calendar\n- Include week of year or week 1/2 alternating pattern on calendar\n- Jump to any month by using the \"Goto\" button\n- Save a month's worth of shifts to your background\n- Share your shifts to others via email, MMS, Facebook or Twitter\n- Import other Shift Worker shifts and view them all within the one app\n- No in-app purchases!\n- No ads!",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat. Also their support is brilliant, they responded in less than an hour of the query I emailed to them.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year. \n  \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves or a White Balance picker. The Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows or sharpen your photo, among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. Use our built-in RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and keep using the tools you are already familiar with.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nEVERYTHING INCLUDED - no IAPs\nCamera+ 2 works great on iPhone and iPad. Use the same tools consistently across all your devices, and take advantage of multitasking in iPad. All features are included in your purchase for all platforms - no in-app purchases required.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.\n\nLIGHTBOX\nPhotos taken with Camera+ 2 go to the Lightbox by default. Filter them easily to focus on the ones you want to work on, and use the built-in editors to create the exact look you are aiming for. Save or share the final versions when you are done.",

    "description": "The Ghost EVP/EMF Radio has been developed for exciting paranormal detection and exploration. We've put a lot of effort into making the app easy to use, so that both professional and enthusiast paranormal researchers, ghost hunters and ghost tour organizers can enjoy the experience.\n\nIf you are either easily frightened, a super skeptic \"left brainer\" or have a serious heart-related medical condition, you are probably better off avoiding this app.\n\nElectronic Voice Phenomena (EVP) is the collective name for the sounds sometimes detected on electronic recordings and reminiscent of human speech. These sounds are usually found in recordings with noise or poor radio reception and are considered by many to be the voices of paranormal beings such as ghosts, spirits, demons and other energy based entities. EVP is a form of Instrumental Trans-Communication (ITC), a term coined by professor Ernst Senkowski in the 1970s.\n\nThis app has taken the traditional ghost box to the next level. As with traditional ghost boxes, chaotic noise seems to be both inviting and sensitive to paranormal manipulation. The app generates audible speech by detecting meaningful phrases and words together with properties such as gender, age and the current mood of the communicating entity. We continuously improve the app, based on user feedback, and use it during our own paranormal investigations as well.\n\n*** Features ***\n* Radio Control Panel where you control the radio in real-time.\n* Brownian, Pink and White Noise generators.\n* Electromagnetic Field Meter using the Magnetometer sensor of your device.\n* Multiple graphical themes for the user interface.\n* Record your encounters with or without the microphone of your device.\n* Real-time audio visualization: Oscilloscope, Spectrometer, Voicegram and Waveform (tap to toggle).\n* Text log screen: The persistent text log is where you can sort, share and delete your log.\n* Quick text log: Tap on the main TV screen to toggle between the different view modes.\n* Open your EVP recordings in compatible audio apps with the touch of a button.\n* Optional Auto Recording which only produces recordings when something interesting is encountered.\n* Optional vibration (iPhone only) and audible alarms every time an entity has been detected.\n* Share your recordings with friends and family.\n* Upload your recordings to your Dropbox.\n\nPlease note that the app will degrade gracefully to Performance mode when running on older hardware, which means that some features may not be available or limited when running on, for example, the iPad 2 or the iPhone 4S.\n\n\n*** Languages ***\nEnglish (UK/US), Czech, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Latin, Polish, Portuguese, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.\n\n\n*** Support ***\n* For support, feedback and more information, please visit https://paranormalsoftware.com/support, or use the buttons on the Settings screen.\n* Knowledge Base: https://paranormalsoftware.com/support/kb\n* Twitter: @GhostRadioEVP\n* Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/ghostevpradio\n* Mailing list: http://tiny.cc/ghostradiomail\n\n\n\nWe hope that you, like many others, will be fascinated by the paranormal experience of Ghost EVP Radio. Thanks for downloading!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nEvery effort has been made to make this app truly unique, but we can offer no guarantee that you will get specific results by using it. Since the results of this app haven't been scientifically verified, it should only be used for entertainment purposes. Please use it responsibly.",

    "description": "The OFFICIAL ABRSM Aural Trainer contains interactive challenges to help develop your music aural skills (listening skills). Anyone can use it, but it is designed around ABRSM’s aural tests for Grades 6 to 8. The app can be used in any order, however often you like, on your own or with your teacher. \n\nUse ABRSM Aural Trainer to:\n• Exercise your musical memory (remember how music sounds and be able to repeat it).\n• Develop your confidence and accuracy at sight-singing (reading and singing the music you see).\n• Improve your recognition of cadences, chords and modulations. \n• Learn to describe texture, structure, dynamics, articulation, tempo and tonality.\n• Practise identifying the features in music that make-up its style and character.\n• Develop the skills to know when a piece of music was written.\n\nThe app covers the following ABRSM aural test content:\n• Melodic Repetition\n• Sight-singing\n• Cadences\n• Chords\n• Modulations\n• Musical Features\n• Rhythmic Repetition\n• Metre\n\nAll exercises are fully interactive. Each one gives you the opportunity to repeat the question, or to compare your response to the correct answer and hear the music again . The app also features supporting tools including a cadence trainer, progress tracker and guides to the aural tests in ABRSM graded music exams.\n\nMany exercises are automatically marked by the application. Self-review and critical listening are also key to successful development of the musical ear, which is why the app provides tools for you to review and evaluate your performance against sample responses in all cases. Your progress is logged whenever you use the app, so you can always see at a glance the areas you might want to revisit.",

Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 30,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once.\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search, night mode and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback.

Explore the lands for resources, recruit loyal subjects, and shore up your defenses — but make haste, for when nightfall comes, a dark and greedy presence awaits… \n\nKingdom: New Lands provides a welcome yet challenging & strategic experience for newcomers and longtime fans alike. Building upon the award-winning twist on tower defense gameplay and mystery of classic Kingdom, New Lands introduces an abundance of new content to the IGF-nominated title while maintaining the simplicity and depth that legions of monarchs have come to cherish. \n\nTravel to the New Lands and welcome the deluge of new mounts, merchants, and vagrants that call these isles home, but be wary of the new obstacles that threaten your arrival - for not just the greedy creatures block your way, but even the environment itself can defeat you.\n\nBe brave, ruler, and fight to the bitter end, lest these New Lands conquer you instead.\n\n-----\n\n“The fact that it’s far deeper than I could have imagined has easily pushed this into my Best of 2017 list.” -Touch Arcade\n\n“A cryptic, gorgeous, and righteously frustrating way to spend time.” -PC Gamer\n\n“I am in love.” -Destructoid\n\n-----\n\nEXPLORE \n\nTraverse the land on horseback to discover all the wealth, secrets, and unlockables that you can use to your advantage.\n\nRECRUIT\n\nAcross the land, wandering vagrants await your orders. Spend gold to recruit them as loyal subjects to help build and bolster your kingdom.\n\nBUILD\n\nDo you need sturdier walls, or taller sentry towers? Farming plots or bakeries? As the leader of your people, shape and sustain your kingdom as you see fit.\n\nDEFEND\n\nThe wisest of monarchs know that the night brings danger. Make sure you’re safe and well protected from the insidious Greed when the sun sets - if they steal your crown, it’s all over!\n\nSTRATEGIZE\n\nTime and gold are both in limited supply. The army of Greed grows stronger with each passing day. The land, while plentiful, can also be harsh. Will you make the right choices of when and where to devote your resources?",

    "description": "The all NEW Enviroute comes with improved features which will let you know if either the M48 Severn bridge or the M4 Prince Of Wales bridge is closed or open in either direction.\nThis new version comes with improved push notifications, a more effective API (backed up with physical and LIVE monitoring of the bridges in person!), additional info on lane closures, and traffic in either direction.\nHere is some info on the Severn Crossings and just why this app is NEEDED for the people of Chepstow! \nEnviroute (Original) has been running for nearly 18 months now completely free of charge, and has over 200 5-Star ratings and reviews.  This NEW improved, paid version will help create more technology projects for the people of Chepstow and the surrounding areas.\nMore features are on their way for Enviroute, and we'll be adding surrounding roads / routes such as the M49 along with routes into Bristol, the M5, and more.\nIf you don't know about the original problems commuters have experienced with the Severn crossings, read on for some background...\nThe Severn bridges based between England and wales are major connections for the M4 and M48 motorways. Traditionally both crossings / bridges have been owned and operated by private companies.\n\n“Is the bridge open” and Enviroute have created an app that allows local residents and commuters to check the status of both bridges in order to plan their routes more effectively. From time to time the bridges are closed due to maintenance and/or adverse weather conditions and, since the ownership of the Severn bridges has changed there has been a lack of reliable communications around the status of the M48 Severn bridge and the M4 Severn Bridge.\n\n“Is the bridge open” is here to help with this and to provide information on when either of the Severn Bridges are closed or partially closed.\nSevern bridge updates at the touch of a button instead of endless maps, websites or twitter accounts. \nFind out instantly is the Severn Bridge is open and get updates sent directly to your device (Enviroute NEW now has this feature!) before you set off on your journey.\nBy paying for Enviroute NEW you are indirectly funding this local area for more exciting tech based projects.  We want to make life easier for residents of the surrounding areas, help local businesses sell more, save your local high-streets plus many more projects in the pipeline.  These will be funded by the money earned by Enviroute NEW\nThank you and I hope you enjoy the new version.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any LG Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your LG TV.\n\nThis works on any LG Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. \n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your LG TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for LG TV app. It will start looking for your LG TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model LG TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for LG TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Mirroring made Easy\" - 5 STARS - by JBGuam\nAbsolutely great app, worked seamlessly with my tv, lag was minimal, but to be fair only receiving 40-45 mbs instead of 100+ mbs in the particular room I tried this. Should be even better with faster internet speeds.\n\n\"Works Great!!\" - 5 STARS - by czerkman\nNot sure why others had problems, I followed the directions and it worked perfectly. Ingenious idea from a developers standpoint.\n\n\"The app works great\" - 5 STARS - by Alivesbg\nNo problems... Good set by step set-up.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "Sharpen your sense of time! liveBPM is the tempo monitoring tool for drummers, bands and DJs. It detects music and beats via the microphone and continuously displays the current tempo in beats per minute (BPM). It is easy to use and delivers high-quality results while being energy efficient.\n\n\n=== What users said about liveBPM ===\n\n\nJohn Walden, freelance musician and music technology journalist at musicappblog.com:\n\"There are three obvious applications for the app. First, it would make a brilliant practice tool for a drummer, allowing them to monitor just how good they are at keeping a steady tempo without the aid of a click track to guide them. Second, sat beside your kit during a performance, it would allow you to judge just how well you are hitting the ideal tempo for each song in your set. It’s not just drummers that can benefit for liveBPM as the third use is in mapping the tempo – and any tempo changes – in commercial recordings. While this is useful for drummers, it is instructional for almost any musician.\" \n\n\nJonLong:\n\"I used this at my last band practice and wasn't expecting it to work. I couldn't believe how quickly and accurately it started tracking the bpm, even despite the very loud volume of our music.\"\n\n\nPocketDrummer82:\n\"I am a professional drummer and I have been looking for something like this for years! Unless your playing with backing tracks or recording, Playing with a Click is too Mechanical. This app allows the tempo to breathe, and its like a little angel on your shoulder telling you the band is speeding up or slowing down. It is totally worth the money.\"\n\n\nChris Walther:\n\"I have used this about five gigs now and have quit using my previous tempo meter. I used both for a few gigs to test the accuracy. Dead on. Thanks! Every drummer should use this.\"\n\n\nmagrec:\n\"This has been very helpful for recording. thanks!\"\n\n\n\n\n=== Detailed Description ===\n\n\nThis is a tool designed for professional use:\n- Well-tested beat detection engine guarantees trustworthiness\n- Can handle most genres\n- Produces results accurate to within 0.1 BPM under the following conditions:\n-- The tempo is constant or almost constant\n-- Strong impulses are defining the beat (drums, accentuated rhythm instruments like bass/guitar, etc.)\n\n\nFurther features:\n- Tempo curve shows the development of tempo over time \n- Multiple zoom modes to show last 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 15, 20 or 30 minutes\n- Advanced audio spectrum analysis via FFT\n- More accessible and usually more accurate than BPM counters that function through tapping\n- Low battery drain thanks to high performance code and efficient algorithms\n\n\nUsing it as a musician:\n- Use it as an objective tempo reference like a metronome\n- It actually has several advantages over a metronome:\n-- You are not tied to a click, giving you more flexibility\n-- Helps you use tempo changes to enhance your musical expression\n-- With blind tests, it can massively improve your timing confidence, which is especially important if you are in a tempo leading role (e.g. drummer)\n- Discover how/whether your favorite artists use tempo changes\n- Measure and improve your time-keeping skills\n- Identify slowdowns and speedups while practicing your instrument\n- Always be in control of the tempo during your live gigs and rehearsals\n\n\nControls:\n- Power Button: For freezing the tempo curve and minimizing battery drain\n- Clear Button: Clears the tempo curve\n- Slider: Adjusts the target tempo range (i.e. 80-160 BPM)\n- Zoom Buttons: Switch between zoom modes for the tempo curve. (2-30 minutes)\n\n\nNote: \n- You can check and improve the detection by clapping loud to the beat. Also, results can be improved by plugging in a suitable external microphone.\n- You can support my work by rating it on the App Store.

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",

    "description": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes, synonyms, antonyms,  homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context).\n\nYou get a database of way over 100,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an internet connection, but if you are on the net when you use the app, it can connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love. Or you can look it up on our sister site, OneLook.com, or even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea! This feature is experimental; registered users of the app will get free upgrades as they become available.\n\nSo whether you're looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!",

You don't need a computers and expensive software to superimpose or blend/mix/combine/cut/copy/paste one photo on top of another any more.\n\nHere is how it works...\n\n1. Load a background image.\n2. Load a foreground image.\n3. Mask out unwanted portion of the foreground image using wide range of masking tools.\n4. Smoothen the edges with smoothen tool inside the app, if required.\n5. Move, Scale, Resize, Rotate, Flip the foreground to place it on the right location on the background image.\n6. Adjust the colors/exposure/contrast/hue/saturation etc. of the foreground and the background images if required to match both the images in terms of colors.\n7. You are done! Save the blended image to the photo library at full resolution or share it on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nYou can also use this tool to do serious photo editing tasks like blending textures or overlaying borders or to do double exposure with adjustable transparency and 18 blending modes.\n\nMasking in the app is the most powerful one available on the app store, just tap on an area of the photo, and the app will mask out all the connected area with similar colors. Or you can use brush, lasso, polygon, global color similarity, rectangle, ellipse, linear, bi-linear, radial gradient, mask from image, mask from text, magic mask and hair refine masking tools. Mask an area with this tool and that area of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.\n\nYou can even drop a shadow of the foreground onto the background.",
