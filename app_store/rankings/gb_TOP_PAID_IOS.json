    "description": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out \"Papa's Freezeria HD\" for iPad!",

    "description": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏",

    "description": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Game entirely in English.\n\n#MadeWithFusion",

    "description": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

We simulate everything. Rain, drizzle, hot and cold temperatures affect tire choice and grip / drift. Air pressure affects the power delivered by the engine, speed and your lap time. More thought than your average driving game.\n- CHOICE: Like F1, a range of tire compounds from different brands are available as you advance.\n- RIVALRIES:  Win your own personal battles. Multiplayer racing will earn you sponsorship if you have the car racing skill and speed!\n-  UPGRADES: Make complex kart / driving game choices: exhaust, seats, brakes, fuel, engines, tyre pressures and setup: Making you fast, slow, grip, drift. \n\n-----  KEY FEATURES -----\nWe’re the no.1 go kart game. Here’s why:\n- On the grid: Real racing against real people.\n- Close: Race in closely matched go karts from real brands - none of this massive upgrade, automatic win!

    "description": "Have you ‘herd’? For eight weeks in the summer of 2021, Worcester will be brought to life by a perfect parade of beautifully decorated elephant sculptures. Elephants – both big and small – will form a stunning, free art trail through the city’s streets and open spaces, bringing together the community for one unforgettable event.\n\nEach sculpture will be sponsored by a business and individually designed by an artist – either well-known or just starting out, from the Worcestershire area or further afield. They’ll march into the city on Monday, 12th July – before leaving on Sunday, 5th September 2021.\n\nAfter this, there will be the chance to say a final ‘goodbye’ at a Farewell Event, before each elephant is auctioned to raise funds for St Richard’s Hospice. There’s a way to go before the trail begins, but we hope you’ll join us on our parade towards summer 2021.\n\nShare in the excitement – and keep up-to-date with the latest news – on our social media channels using #WorcsBigParade",

    "description": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. \n\n\"It took some time and patience... but I found it... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the UK and 101 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's heartbeat and other sounds - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first but you can really hear the heart beat! Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's sounds and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nIt takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it.\n\nWhen you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with HMB and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your baby heartbeat.\n\n**** Works Beautifully From 27 Weeks ****\nIt is possible (but less likely) to hear from as early as 16-20 weeks, best results are most often achieved as the baby gets larger.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best results\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for HMB to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive in the heartbeat range.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\nX, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - we wouldn't wish to claim otherwise. Under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong with your baby :)- Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA or any other medical authority. This is not a medical device. \n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp",

    "description": "Researchers at Monash University have developed the low FODMAP diet and a corresponding app to assist in the management of gastrointestinal symptoms associated with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The Monash University FODMAP diet works by swapping foods high in fermentable carbohydrates (FODMAPs), with low FODMAP alternatives. Around 75% of people with IBS experience symptom relief on a low FODMAP diet.\n\nThe app comes directly from the research team at Monash and includes the following:\n\n- General information about the FODMAP diet and IBS.\n- Easy to understand tutorials to guide you through the app and the 3-Step FODMAP diet.\n- A Food Guide detailing the FODMAP content for hundreds of foods using a simple 'traffic light system'. \n- A list of branded products that have been certified by Monash as low FODMAP.\n- A collection of over 70 nutritious, low FODMAP recipes.\n- Functions that allow you to create your own shopping list and add notes to individual foods\n- A Diary that enables you to record food eaten, IBS symptoms, bowel habits and stress levels. The Diary will also guide you through step 2 of the diet - FODMAP reintroduction.\n- The ability to adjust units of measurement (metric or imperial) and activate colour blindness assistance.",

    "description": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation.",

There will be over 40 cow sculptures, each one individually designed by an artist and sponsored by a business, forming a free, fun, family-friendly trail of discovery for local people to explore and enjoy.\r\n\r\nDuring the trail as well as the large cows, you can also spot a further 45 mini moos, dotted around the city created by schools, colleges and community groups.\r\n\r\nThere will be a final ‘legend-dairy’ farewell event at The Grafton for your last chance to see your favourite sculptures. After this event the mini moos will return to their creators.\r\n\r\nThis legacy of Cows about Cambridge will continue as the large sculptures will be auctioned to raise vital funds for local children’s charity, Break.\r\n\r\nTo find out where the sculptures will be located download the app or pick up a trail map from a range of locations around the city.\r\n\r\nWe hope you enjoy the trail and we would like to encourage you to share your images on the app, or via social media using the #cowsaboutcambridge.\r\n\r\nGood Luck!",

    "description": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.",

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!",

A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome back to the new and improved Freddy Fazbear's Pizza!\n\nIn Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the old and aging animatronics are joined by a new cast of characters. They are kid-friendly, updated with the latest in facial recognition technology, tied into local criminal databases, and promise to put on a safe and entertaining show for kids and grown-ups alike!\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\nAs the new security guard working nights, your job is to monitor cameras and make sure nothing goes wrong after-hours. The previous guard has complained about the characters trying to get into the office (he has since been moved to day-shift). So to make your job easier, you've been provided with your very own empty Freddy Fazbear head, which should fool the animatronic characters into leaving you alone if they should accidentally enter your office.\n\nAs always, Fazbear Entertainment is not responsible for death or dismemberment.\n\nNOTE: Game entirely in English.\n\n#MadeWithFusion",

    "description": "Over the past few years, the Scottish Curriculum underwent a major change. One of those changes was the introduction of the Curriculum for Excellence. This has normally been accessed through a Word or PDF document or through a folder located in the classroom. The Curriculum for Excellence App makes accessing the Curriculum for Excellence Experiences and Outcomes easier for Staff, parents and pupils directly on their devices.\n\nThe use of this App will allow those interested in accessing the Scottish 3-18 Curriculum with ease. Content has been assembled from the Education Scotland Website and once installed requires no access to the internet to be used.\n\nAs a Teacher myself, I found it difficult to access the information readily in a meeting or general discussion while in school or away at a training day. Either I had to lug about the Experiences and Outcomes folder all the time or be left without it at critical moments in meetings and discussions.\n\nEqually, while planning and trying to match up cross-curricular themes, the folder made the task more difficult due to the size of it. When a meeting was scheduled, Experiences and Outcomes were printed so everyone had a copy for the discussion. I set about creating something we could all access and use, while at the same time reducing unnecessary printing and additional costs.\n\nThe Curriculum for Excellence app will sit quietly in your phone and should you require to access an E and O at a point in a meeting, or check its relation during an in-service day or educational talk, then this will make it easier to stay focused on what is being discussed and not be thinking about where your folder is or what page you need to turn to.\n\nPlease come back and rate this app once you have used it. I know it seems so petty, but this helps other teachers, interested bodies, parents and pupils find it and use it. Even a small like will help out a great deal.\n\nI have tried my best to make the Curriculum for Excellence app as simple to access as possible and for it to be accessible to as many IOS devices I am able, knowing that technology is moving faster than we are able to purchase gadgets and tech. With that in mind, if you have a suggestion, concern or complaint, please get in touch and let me know so I can try to develop it, fix it or address it.\n\nThank you for your support.\n\n(The developer has no affiliation with Education Scotland.)",

    "description": "Ship Finder shows live moving ships on a worldwide map. The intuitive design combined with incredible performance puts you in control. Watch in full screen, view in AR, search, add filters and so much more!\n\nShip Finder has been top rated and top ranking since 2009 and covers most of the world, tracking 30,000+ ships simultaneously.\n\nOur incredible app performance means that you can see all tracked vessels at once.\nSimply tap a ship to see its name, type, photos, speed, dimensions and much more.\nPowerful features such as filters, search, night mode and the ability to save favourite ships are included. (You can choose Apple or Google maps too!).\n\nAdd and browse bookmarks to saved locations around the globe to quickly navigate to areas or ports of interest.\n\nYou can even use Augmented Reality (AR) view to identify ships out at sea using your device camera. \n\nShip Finder works by picking up AIS ship feeds used by all passenger vessels, vessels over 300 tons and increasingly by smaller pleasure craft and yachts. This technology is actually faster than radar and is used by vessels for safety and navigation.\n\nShip Finder provides near real time “virtual radar” AIS maps. It’s easy to use and is an amazing app for anyone interested in shipping, cruising and sailing in ports and locations across the world. It’s also great if you simply want to know what boats are out there or want to see where your friends and family are. Ship Finder is also used extensively by maritime professionals and mariners.\n\nOur global AIS coverage is impressive and expanding all of the time as we add new AIS feeds and receivers. Please check www.shipfinder.co regularly to see the latest coverage.\n\nPinkfroot are committed to customer service and continually improve our Ship Finder apps based on feedback. Why not join our online community at www.pinkfroot.com or if you have any questions please email us via support@pinkfroot.com and we’ll be happy to help. \n\nDisclaimer: Ship Finder should not be used for navigational purposes. \nUnder no circumstances will the developer of this application be held responsible for incidents resulting from the use of the data or its interpretation.",

The Isle of Man is included only at 1:250,000 (free) and 1:50,000 (paid).\n\nSince 2010, Britain's national mapping agency Ordnance Survey has released a large amount of free map data.  UK Map makes much of that data available in a single app. It includes 1:1M MiniScale® and 1:250k road maps, which are built into the app, and 1:25k district maps and 1:10k street maps for the entire country which you can download in 5km by 5km tiles.  As the free O.S. data does not include footpaths, this app superimposes footpaths derived from volunteer-collected data from OpenStreetMap.org.  These downloads are free of charge.\n\nIn addition to the free maps, you can also purchase and download 1:50,000 and 1:25,000 maps that are just like the Ordnance Survey paper maps.  You can also purchase 1:10,000 maps for selected urban areas which show more detail than the free 1:10,000 maps.\n\nOnce you've downloaded the detailed maps that you need, an internet connection is not required.\n\nThe app can load GPX files (for example, from websites, other apps and from nearby devices via AirDrop) and display waypoints, tracks and routes.  You can also mark waypoints, plan routes and record tracks within the app, and export them.\n\nYou can view graphs of altitude or speed along recorded tracks and routes.\n\nThe app has a 3D mode that lets you view the terrain from any viewpoint, useful for visualising hills and mountains.\n\nThe app also includes a searchable gazetteer containing over 250,000 place names, 850,000 street names and 1.6 million post codes. All of this data is built in to the app, so this search also works when there is no network connection.\n\nThe app also supports the compass and GPS - on those devices that have them - to display your position, orientation and altitude.\n\nPaid maps are licensed for personal and non-commercial use only.\n\nContains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database rights 2011 - 2021.

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

It also guides you through all three stages of the diet, from FODMAP restriction, to the reintroduction food challenges and personalisation. Dietary triggers are difficult to identify but research has shown that some carbohydrates (FODMAPs) may contribute to irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Restricting FODMAP intake has been shown to improve IBS symptoms caused by food intolerance but this may not apply to everyone. \n\nUsing the app, you will be able to manage all three stages of the low FODMAP diet to create a dietary plan, search and scan barcodes to find low FODMAP suitable foods, improve your chances of successfully following the low FODMAP diet and then re-introducing foods to understand the ingredients that are triggering your symptoms.\n\n\nKey features:\n• Scan barcodes to check low FODMAP suitable foods\n• Search quickly and easily for everyday low FODMAP foods\n• Quickly check the suitability of foods and see guidance on portion sizes\n• Review tips & tricks from the dietitian\n• Create your own personalised FODMAP profile\n• At each stage track and record your symptoms\n• Review full product ingredient and nutrition facts from food label\n• Create your own personalised shopping lists\n\nThis app has been designed and developed in partnership with medical experts and dietitians from Kings College London and Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust.

(2020). It showed that over half of users with symptoms before starting the diet report symptom improvement following FODMAP restriction.\n\n\nThe advice and guidance with the app is reviewed and updated quarterly by relevant dietitians and researchers, or more frequently if a discrepancy is brought to our attention from a dietitian or patient user. New and existing app features are tested with dietitians and users and feedback is taken into consideration for future enhancements - if you are a user or dietitian please write to us with your thoughts anytime at help@foodmaestro.me.\n\nPlease note:\nDue to the highly personalised features within this app you are required to create a user account in order to use the search filters, try a food challenge or custom filters.\n•\tTerms apply see https://service.foodmaestro.me/docs/TOC.html\n•\tFor more information on our privacy policy please go to https://service.foodmaestro.me/docs/PrivacyPolicy.html\n•\tIf you have any queries or questions related to the download or use of the app please email us at help@foodmaestro.me and we will aim to get back to you within two business days. \n\n\nWARNING: This application and the information that it contains do NOT constitute medical advice and should NOT serve as the basis for any medical decision by you or anyone else.

    "description": "“Top of the pile of bird song recognition apps” - Bird Watching magazine\nThe only birdsong app that can safely be used on nature reserves!\nFeatured by Apple in 'Celebrate Springtime’\n\nChirpOMatic is an excellent way to identify bird sounds around you. Simply record a bird singing and use Automatic Recognition to identify it. The app can work wherever you are - if you don’t have internet or a mobile connection then the app analyses the sound on the device. And unlike other bird apps, our special Bird-Safe mode means that the app can even be used in nature reserves without the risk of disturbing birds. \n\nThe app works rather like Shazam® does for music. When you hear a bird, quickly hold up your phone and start recording. The app analyses the sound, and shows you the top matches. You can compare your recording with the reference samples to check the identification. And if you don't have your phone with you, you can use your Apple Watch to record sounds for identification later.\n\nAll your recordings are stored on your phone so you can listen to them again or share them with friends. You can help us improve the app by sending us the sound to use in training our system. The best recordings are posted (with your permission) on the Xeno-canto website, the world-wide resource for bird and bird sound research.\n\n\"Excitedly playing with it in my garden - robins, blue & great tit so far :):)\"\n\"My new absolute favourite app - #Chirpomatic (It's basically Shazam for birds!!)\"\n\"It is really easy to use and intuitive, which is essential!\"\n\"I've already learnt the calls of 5 garden birds....such a great app.\"\n\n************\nPLEASE NOTE! This version of the app is for Europe. For North American birds please search for ChirpOMatic USA.\n************\n\nShazam® is the registered trademark of Shazam Entertainment Limited and is not affiliated with iSpiny in any way.",

    "description": "Here is the long-awaited successor to our critically acclaimed flight simulator for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It simulates the Space Shuttle approach and landing in incredible detail and accuracy.\n\n\nThis is a completely new version, rewritten from scratch. Our custom rendering engine delivers desktop class flight simulation to mobile devices: a unique combination of realistic flight dynamics, stunning graphics, and fun game play.\n\n\nYou’ve never landed a Space Shuttle before? We’ve got you covered: Included are several tutorials with varying degrees of autopilot assist. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again.\n\nEach flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. After your first safe touchdown, chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different wind conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles.\n\nYou control the Orbiter’s pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks or use a gamepad. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we’ve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they’ll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it’s your turn to give it a try.\n\nA new orbit mode lets you take the Orbiter for a spin around the planet, and we’re working on a full atmospheric re-entry scenario, which, among other new features, will be released as free updates in the coming months.\n\nThere are no ads or in app purchases, and we don’t collect any personal data.",
