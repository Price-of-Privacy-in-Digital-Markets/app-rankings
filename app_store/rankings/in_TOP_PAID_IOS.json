Just sleep!\n\nTotal Privacy.\n-------------\nAutoSleep has no user analytics tracking. No advertising plugins. No 3rd party code. No data upload.\nAsk your \"free\" sleep app if they can say the same.\n\nEverything Included.\n--------------------\nNo extra In App Purchases. No subscriptions. \n\nAbout AutoSleep\n-----------------\nUsing Advanced Heuristics AutoSleep works out how long you've slept so you don't have to.\n\nIf you DO wear your Watch to bed, you don't need to do a single thing. AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning.\n\nEven if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.\n\nIf you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher.

Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR.

We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you.

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat. Also their support is brilliant, they responded in less than an hour of the query I emailed to them.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing.

    "description": "QUICK SEARCH AND SET OF CONTACTS\nNew utility ICaller from KiraLine Inc is a modern search engine that you can use to very quickly find the person you want and dial his number, irrespective of how large your notebook is. Therefore, this program is particularly useful when driving and when traffic on the road is very slow. Now you just need to type two or three numbers or letters and the utility would display the list of matches, and only need to lightly touch the screen to call the person.\n\nT9 SYSTEM FOR YOUR IPHONE\nYou can search for a contact through the T9 system, which is one of the most popular among mobile phone users around the world. With the T9 system, you type a word, focusing on the keys, each of which has 4-5 letters. Thus, the typing speed increases, while the smart program picks up the word you are looking for.\n\nTWO WORDS IN ONE SEARCH\nWe all come across common names. For example, my phonebook contains 15 people answering Sergeyev, who have different surnames or belong to different aspects of my life. In one of the latest updates, the iCaller developers designed the search system for two words. Use the button \"1\" for additional filtering of contacts.\n\nFAST SMS MESSAGES, AND REMOVAL OF CONTACTS FROM CALL HISTORY\nOur application features maximum functionality at a time and this is of paramount importance to us. You can send SMS from the main screen by swiping your finger over the contact: swiping it in one direction sends SMS, swiping to the other direction deletes a contact from the call history. The same operation is also available from the dial string.\n\nFAVORITE CONTACTS – SELECTED FEATURES\nThe ICaller utility is fully integrated with the phone book, in which you can add and edit contacts, and create a list of up to 50 favorite contacts for speed dialing, adding the photo of a loved one or colleague to the name. You can interchange the position of contact icons, add new ones and instantly dial a number or send an SMS message.\n\nFINE TUNING THE UTILITY FOR YOUR TASTE \nThe program supports advanced options you can use to customize iCaller for yourself. Here, you can enable/disable the sound and tips, and delete call history. In the settings, you can select the priority search by name or surname. This is especially important where two-word search is possible. Screen settings would enable you select the background of the screen, choose the main contact number or display a list to choose from and select the type of image - icons with photos or name of the contact. You can also select the main screen at startup - Favorites or keyboard for searching and dialing a contact.\n\nICALLER SUPPORTS THE MAJOR LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD \nIn the settings, you can choose the primary and secondary language. Note that iCaller supports 5 languages. You can search in Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.\n\nWe welcome your suggestions and feedback at info@kiraline.com.\n\nPlease often go to our official Facebook page for new games and applications!\nwww.facebook.com/kiralineinc",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

If your city is not in the list, you just select the closest one.\n\nWith the search tool, you can:\n- Write \"Prad\", you'll get the full list of Pradosh vrat of the year (worship of Lord Shiva, which is observed on the Trayodashi of both the fortnight - Shukla and Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Eka\", you'll get the full list of Ekadashi of the year (Ekadashi occurs on the 11th day of the bright half - called Shukla Paksha and on the 11th of the dark half called Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Chatur\", you'll get the full list of Ganesha and Vinayak Chaturthi of the year\n- Write \"Rohini\" or \"Ashtami\", and so on...\n\nOur calendar complied a Hindu Panchang according to Vedic science and modern outlook.

    "description": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

    "description": "GeoShred Pro Version 5, is an exciting update, now with In-App-Purchases for GeoSWAM instruments on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater.  \n\nImagine a new kind of musical instrument ... \n\nAn instrument where a performer can fluidly express multiple independent voices.  An instrument that is both pitch fluid, and helps the performer precisely reach desired musical pitches in any temperament.  \n\nGeoShred is an award-winning,  fluidly expressive musical instrument that runs on multi-touch devices. \n\nIt has a performance surface with “almost magic” pitch rounding algorithms which is coupled with a model of the physics of several types of musical instruments, support for AUv3, MIDI In/Out, MPE, and 3D Touch.  It’s a fusion of Jordan Rudess’ performance concepts and a powerful, modeled guitar/effects based on the Physical Modeling research of Dr. Julius O. Smith III of Stanford/CCRMA.  And, GeoShred's expressive control can be used with other synthesizers.\n\nTens of thousands of artists in 48 countries perform GeoShred with 30% of those users in India. \n\nGeoShred is the Gold Medal Winner of the 2019 Denny Award, winner of a 2019 Guthman New Musical Instrument Award, and winner of the 2017 Electronic Musician Editor's Choice Award as \"one of the most innovative, groundbreaking products to emerge in the past twelve months\".\n\n\nGeoShred Pro Version 5 Features include:\n\n• In-App-Purchases (IAP) for 6 different GeoSWAM instruments, GeoViolin, GeoFlute, GeoTenoSax, GeoCello, GeoClarinet, and GeoOboe \n• A fluidly expressive playing surface + a Physically modeled guitar\n• Au3 plugin support on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater \n• Intelligent pitch rounding\n• A diatonic keyboard where every key on the screen is in the scale.\n• MIDI IN/OUT and MPE support\n• MIDI control using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, virtual MIDI and all digital interfaces \n• MIDI configuration presets\n• 3D touch on iPhones that support 3D touch\n• Customizable control surface can be mapped to physical MIDI controls\n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus support.\n• Backing tracks\n• Multiple Modeled effects\n• Modeled feedback and VCF effects\n• Echo, a unique looper and multi-tap echo \n• Finger vibrato, slide and fret scraping\n• Unique mono mode using intervals of multiple strings. \n• Built-in Arpeggiator\n• Alternative tunings and temperaments\n• Support for world scales and temperaments including Indian Ragas, Arabic and Balinese scales. \n• Easily share presets with friends\n\n---\n \nPraise for the GeoShred family of apps: \n\n“GeoShred is brilliant- it’s a real instrument.” – Eddie Jobson\n\n“A fantastic new invention which is going to revolutionize the way music is played, expressed and learned! “GeoShred” is one of the foremost best musical inventions I’ve had the pleasure to experience in recent years. Definitely 5 stars out of 5! GIGANTASTIVISSIMO…..R…A…Z !!!!!” – Patrick Moraz\n\n“That’s just nuts. You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.  It would mean a lot to us if you could leave your positive review on the App Store and If you have any questions about GeoShred we would love to hear from you at our support email address: support@moforte.com \n\n---\n\nMinimum Requirements:  iOS 11.4 or better is required for AUv3, iCloud and GeoSWAM instruments.\n***Note: The GeoSWAM instruments can ONLY be performed from the GeoShred keyboard or MPE controllers.\n***Note: Unfortunately, due to App Store limitations, previously purchased instrument IAPs can not be applied to a purchase of the collection IAP.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Panasonic Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Panasonic TV.\n\nThis works on any Panasonic Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. For the latest Panasonic TV models, please enable DMR (Digital Media Renderer) in TV Settings: WIth your remote control, go to: Menu / Setup / Network / Application / DMR: ON\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Panasonic TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Panasonic TV app. It will start looking for your Panasonic TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Panasonic TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Panasonic TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

Using G.L.O.P.P. (Gluon Liquid Omega-Phased Plasma), the maniacal Mech Morphix has transformed the creatures of New York City into an army of bloodthirsty mutants. In Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project, Duke must deploy W.I.N. (Weapons, Insults and Name-Calling) to rid the city of goo-based bad guys, and return peace and tranquility to The City That Never Sleeps. \n\nOriginally released to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Duke Nukem in 2002, Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project blends together the best elements of Duke Nukem 3D and the best 2D sidescrolling of the first two games in the series, Duke Nukem and Duke Nukem II. \n\nFrom babes, bombs and Battlelords, to goggles, guns and Gargoyles, revisit Duke's dynasty with these re-released classics. Return to a time when the King Of Action didn't need regenerative health or auto-aim - a time when action games were actually about action, an era when heroes had the strength to carry as many guns as they wanted and use as many cheats as they needed. \n\nCelebrate Duke Nukem's 20th anniversary in sunshade-wearing, quick-quipping style with a title that - alongside the re-release of Duke's first two adventures - recognizes a series that's had a tremendous impact on an entire industry, and represents the best of Duke in a way that no other game could.\n\n***   Key Features:   ***\n\nA Good Day To Duke: Rip 'em a new one with 9 brand new weapons, including the G.L.O.P.P. Ray, Pipe Bomb, Pulse Cannon and the almighty \"press-to-kill-everything\" X-3000.\n\nNew York, New York:  8 huge levels across various regions of New York City: Rooftop Rebellion, Chinatown Chiller, Metro Madness, Unholy Underworld, Fearsome Factory, Tanker Trouble and Deviant Drilling. And the last level is, let's say, a little out of town. \n\nEvil Has A Snout: Blast, jump and smart-ass through more than 25 enemies, including Pig Cops, Gator Grunts, and Roachoids.\n\nWhat Are You Waitin' For?: A potent blend of old school gameplay and smooth 3D visuals, Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project brings together the best of both Dukes for the ultimate Duke Nukem experience.\n\nLet's rock!",

    "description": "Jazza's ARTY GAMES is a fun tool you can use to accompany your drawing sessions to practice with, challenge yourself, and most of all, have fun with your art!\n\nDISCLAIMER: There is no 'in-app' drawing, this app is an accompaniment to your drawing sessions to be used for generating ideas and challenges.\n\nThe ARTY GAMES app features:\n- Multiple Profiles (each with materials and game/app settings)\n- Single play mode with 8 fun game options (Time limit optional)\n- Challenge Mashup mode for Rapid-Fire Art Challenges!\n\nIn Single play mode you can play with or without a time limit and challenge yourself with one of eight fun idea generation and art practice games.\n\n1 - COLOR CHALLENGE:\nThe Color Challenge game assigns you between 1-5 colors you’re limited to creating your artwork with. The game generates these colors from the colored materials you add to your Arty Games profile such as paint and color pencils. You can also add Markers by brand and build your materials from the official colors and sets for each brand! That way you can Play games like the 3-marker challenge without messing up your collection of markers!\n\n2 - CHARACTER CHALLENGE\nThe Character Challenge generates random combinations of Character Designs and Scenarios for you to draw. These can turn out funny, or epic – and there are billions of combinations to be explored!\n\n3 - ENVIRONMENT CHALLENGE\nThe Environment Challenge generates a scene for you to draw based in either an Interior or Exterior environment.\n\n4 - INCREMENTAL DESIGN\nIn the Incremental Design challenge, you draw a character’s head or body in 5 stages which are revealed one by one, so you won’t know what the final design will be until the very end – surprises lie in store!\n\n5 - SCRIBBLE CHALLENGE\nThe scribble Challenge generates a random doodle for you to copy down and turn into a work of art.\n\n6 - COPY CHALLENGE\nIn the Copy challenge, you are given an image to reproduce as closely as possible, which will help your observation and drawing skills, and can be a good warm-up to a drawing session too!\n\n7 - DESIGN MIX\nThe Design Mix challenge presents you with two random items which you must thematically or aesthetically combine in a creative way.\n\n8 - CUSTOM GENERATOR\nThe Custom Generator allows you to build your own lists to generate ideas and games from. The possibilities are LITERALLY endless!\n\nIf you’re really up for a challenge, you can start a Challenge Mashup!\n\nCHALLENGE MASHUP MODE:\nThis mode is great to challenge yourself in, or play with a group of friends. Simply select the number of challenges you want to play and the time limit (do you want the rounds to speed up or slow down?), and after you pick the games you want to be included, hit GO and get ready for a mashup of insane challenges that will test the skill of even the most experienced artists.\n\nCREDITS and THANKS:\nJosiah (Jazza) Brooks - App design, lead development, art and animation addict/maker\nMatthew Stradwick - Programmer\nKate Taylor Marsden - Business manager, administration, shop overlord\nLochie Axon - UI Design\nRobert Coulter (Kazilik) - Version 1 programmer, destroyer of worlds\nSteelribs and Dungeonkills - Data sorting and gathering mega-super awesome assistants!

The pay and benefits are nice, but you took the job for that coveted Line-Jump Pass for the amusement park right outside the shop.

The method has been used in more than 30 international clinical studies in the past 20 years. \n\nIt gives you the ability to assess and quantify your tremor and to keep track of your values. You can upload your results as Text Files to your iCloud Drive for further visualization, or to share and import them to personal EHR apps. \n\nFor more information, visit www.studymyhealth.com\n\nTremor is the notion for the trembling of a limb. Most prominent is the trembling of the outstretched hand, that everyone is aware of in special situations like excitement or strenuous workouts. Whereas a light trembling of the hand is present in all humans, increased amplitude of the trembling can lead to serious problems in daily life. Increased trembling could be a symptom of a wide variety of diseases, as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor disease, hypothyroidism, or various psychiatric conditions.\n\nTHIS APP IS NOT INTENDED TO DIAGNOSE, TREAT, OR CURE ANY DISEASE.\n\nNote: Tremor severity and frequency are not supported by iHealth; as soon as these values are available we will connect the App to the iHealth ecosystem. \n\niPad Users: Note that the App is not working on the iPad; it does NOT make sense to measure hand tremor using an iPad, the device is too large and heavy to perform the measurements.",

If the park is to open on time, you have to help Freddi Fish and Luther find the clues, solve the puzzles, and get to the bottom of this watery predicament. \n\n—User Reviews— \n“Highly recommended--and not just for children--for anyone who loves old-fashioned, point-and-click, mouse-controlled adventure games with beautiful animation. If you have never before tried any of the Humongous products, then you are in for a pleasant surprise, and you may find yourself sneaking to the computer once your child is sound asleep.” \n\n“I played with Clare for a lot of this game, not because she needed me to, but because we both wanted to. At 8 years old she would certainly be in the top end of the target audience, and my input into what to do next was negligible. She was able to work her way through all the conundrums, with only the occasional nudge. She thought that the game was \"just right\" as far as the challenges were concerned.”\n\n“This adventure game provides kids with plenty of opportunities to develop problem-solving skills as they sleuth their way through a colorful underwater world.”\n\nFEATURES:\n• New locations and puzzles each time you play! \n• Packed with puzzles, games and activities! \n• Find the clues and collect the tools to solve the mystery!\n\nThis product uses ScummVM which is released under the GNU GPL v2. \nFor more information, please visit - https://www.scummvm.org \nThe GNU GPL can be viewed here - https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html",

It's an incredible tool for all audio engineers and musicians ... My mixing has improved by leaps and bounds after just a few weeks with Quiztones.”\n\n- Austin McAllister\n\n\nA professional Audio Engineer of 10 years, I've come across many ear training devices, blind tests, and software. This app is TOPS! Highly recommended! The developers are serious about what they do. You will not be disappointed!\n\n- Joel Avery\n\n——\n\nWhy We Created Quiztones EQ Ear Training Apps ...\n\nWe thought there should be an easier way to learn how to use EQ, train your ears and expedite the path to getting professional quality mixes, recordings and productions.\n\nWhen I was at music school ten years ago studying audio engineering and music production, my teacher turned an iMac around, pulled up an EQ in Pro Tools and started quizzing the class on which audio frequencies he was boosting or cutting in a mix. That's when it hit me — this should be an app, with various difficulty levels, a scoring system and the ability to import your own source material for quizzes that will teach you how to use EQ like a pro.\n\nFast forward to today — 50k app downloads later — and we're still just as excited to keep evolving Quiztones to help you take the quality of your mixes, recordings and productions to the next level.",

    "description": "The program calculates the drawing diagram of Carbon and Stainless Steel wires, Bronze, Aluminium, Zinc  and Copper wires. For Aluminium and Bronze, we considered the analysis more popular and with the higher tensile strength. For Zinc we considered the material with 99% of base material. Matra is working in English, Italian, French and German languages.\n\nIt calculates the diameter sequence and the relative reduction, the material tensile strength, the needing drawing force, the speed and the power for each pass. It calculates also the productivity in kg/h of the machine.\nIt is possible to work with constant or with decreasing reductions, to set the reduction of the last block and, in the case of external skinpass, to set the value of it. It suggests also the needing  dies number letting you enter your choice in the underneath field.\n\nIt foresees the final tensile strength of the material basing its calculation on practical values.\nMatra is indicated for drawing mills managers, with the aim to define the better drawing diagram in order to optimise the die scheduling.\nIt calculates also the productivity of the machine with possibility to set the efficiency of it.\nIt calculates the draw per pass using the Siebel’s formulas of the Homogeneous Work, as inside specified.\nThe Matra new version 2.0 is calculating now also the diagram for the wet drawing machines managing the slip for each capstan and controlling the total slip per cent on all the drawing blocks. First the program is asking you to enter the data of the wet drawing machine, as number of dies and elongations per pass. It is also possible to load the data of machines already existing in the market. One time the machine data are entered and checked it is possible to enter the inlet diameter, the outlet diameter and the slip requested per each capstan. It is possible to select 4 types of standard slipping or to enter a custom slip defined by the user. The program proposes then the needing number of dies to obtain the final diameter. After your choice the final report is showing the machine elongation per pass, the wire elongation, reduction and the total slip per pass.\nIn the version 2.1.0 is also possible to enter, in the section wet drawing slipping machines, your own program and to verify elongations, reductions and slip per pass relative to the characteristics of the chosen machine.\nImproved also the readability with iPad.\nIt is possible also to use the program in your Mac.\nThe App is working also in dark mode.\n\nThe program works with International  Unit Measure (SI) or with  United States Imperial Units (USC).",
