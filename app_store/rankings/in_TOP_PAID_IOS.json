It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.\n\nFor Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR. Shoot in RAW (even in BURST), split focus / exposure, and manually control everything (exposure, iso, shutter speed, white balance and focus).\n\nFor Everyone Else - inspired by the pro’s we made the interface simple, fast, and easy to use. We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you.

Take better photos, faster.\n+ Apple Watch - Use your watch as a remote to shoot photos or record videos.\n+ Siri Shortcuts - Quick access to capture a photo or start a video\n\nRAW and 3D shutter require an iPhone 6S or later (6S, 7, 8, X, XS, XR, SE)",

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+.

    "description": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved",

Type in their phone number and hit search, very shortly you will see tons of data on where their phone is registered. It will tell you if it is landline or a cellphone.  It will tell you what phone company it is from. It even uses smart statistics to determine the highest likelihood the coordinates are accurate.  Even better, you will instantly see maps showing you exactly where that is, and how far it is from your current position.  \n\n------------- \n**IMPORTANT** \n------------- \nThis is not a cellphone tracker, it is a number lookup and refers to the location the number is registered. \n\nContains FULL data for the entire United States AND Canada.  \n\nTop Features Include: \n- *** Data updates at least quarterly, so it will continue to be accurate. \n- Search and get full data on AREA CODES or full phone numbers. \n- Lovely animated graphics \n- Lightning fast speed \n- Use swipe gestures or the UI, your choice. \n- Works either offline or online. \n- Fully retina compatible for iPhone, iPhone 5, and the new iPad \n- Auto updating web tab \n- A fully universal application that can be used on iPod touch, iPhone, and iPad. No need to purchase a separate HD/XL application for your iPad. \n- On the iPad the application will work in all orientations. You can hold it any way you like and it will keep up. \n- Developed by an experienced programmer. No crashing, memory leak problems, or other annoying experiences. \n- A dedicated developer who will add more features and keep improving the application. I love to get suggestions of features. \n- A low price. Why pay more money for lesser apps? \n\nYou know what is annoying? When people make you buy a separate app for the iPhone and then again for the iPad by adding an XL on the end of the name.  We do not do this to you.  This is a universal app that will work on both your iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch at no extra cost to you.\n\nSpeaking of the iPad version of the application, we went all out and put the entire iPad screen to use.  We love the way the app runs on the iPad and we hope you will too.\n\nThis app is written by a small company, so you know we care about the app and will work our hearts out to keep it running great for years to come.  If you have a good idea for the next version, let us know and we will do our best to add it in.\n\nTalking about money is normally the awkward part of any business transaction.  In our case, we are happy to skip that and let you know  that we are only charging you .99 cents for our app.  We hope you like it as much as we do.",

    "description": "An educational game for children ages 2-4 from the series \"Kids Learn Words\".\n\nTogether with your child, look at bright, colorful flashcards from the \"human world\" accompanied by sounds, learn the names of these man-made objects, and listen to the sounds they make!\n\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she has learned. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child’s developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\n\nThe educational flashcards for kids are divided into the following categories: “Cars and Transport”, “Professions”, “Buildings”, “Musical Instruments”, “Tools”, “Furniture”, “Kitchen Tools” and “Clothing and shoes”. \n\nOne important distinction makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify as a real object, the child will see bright, beautiful and fun-spirited photographs. This will allow the child to “see” each object as it actually appears in the real world, while allowing the parent to tell the child more about this object.\n\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! In addition to English, this app also supports the Spanish, German and many other languages. \n\nWhile playing with the educational flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their teachers and classmates. An A+ is guaranteed!\n\nThe youngster does not need to be able to read in order to use this educational app. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently. \n\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \n\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\n\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.",

    "description": "The TSRA Clinical Scenarios in Cardiothoracic Surgery app strives to enhance surgical education by providing an aggregation of common surgical problems in general thoracic, adult cardiac, and congenital cardiac surgery. Users are given a typical clinical presentation with associated options for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, followed by a series of “what if” scenarios that might influence the approach to the patient’s clinical state. \n\nUsers encouraged to take notes on each topic, and they can be stored on the device for future reference. Notes can be shared with every user of the app through the “Community Notes” section, and other users can comment on shared notes. TSRA hopes to make this a “living document” and encourage a dialogue among the users to enhance the understanding of complex surgical issues. Specific notes and comments regarding the oral ABTS examination, however, are prohibited and not endorsed by the TSRA. Users are also encouraged to rate the quality of each chapter as well as mark specific chapters as “Favorites.”\n\nThe Thoracic Surgery Residents Association (TSRA) represents the interests of all residents in training in cardiothoracic surgery in North America. TSRA works with the Thoracic Surgery Directors Association (TSDA)  to improve the quality of thoracic surgical education, keeping that training abreast of changes within the field, and assisting in creative solutions for educational problems.\nTSRA resources are provided as a basic guideline for the study of cardiothoracic surgery and should be used in conjunction with a variety of other educational references and resources. TSRA resources should not be construed as definitive study guides for either the TSDA In-Training Exam or the ABTS Certification Exam. TSRA makes no claims regarding the study guide’s value in preparing for, or its contribution toward performance on, either the TSDA In-Training Exam or the ABTS Certification Exam.  TSRA resources are educational tools only, and any medical decisions should be after discussions with appropriate healthcare providers.",

Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.\n \nSlow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:\n \nMOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.\n\nLIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.
