    "description": "Featured in LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\nDa Vinci Eye is the #1 essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Sony Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Sony TV.\n\nThis works on any Sony Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. \n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Sony TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Sony TV app. It will start looking for your Sony TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Sony TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Sony TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you.

Take better photos, faster.\n+ Apple Watch - Use your watch as a remote to shoot photos or record videos.\n+ Siri Shortcuts - Quick access to capture a photo or start a video\n\nRAW and 3D shutter require an iPhone 6S or later (6S, 7, 8, X, XS, XR, SE)",

Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nShould you choose not to subscribe, after one year, you will continue to receive updates in the form of bug fixes and compatibility updates with the latest devices, iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4 then, that very same app in 2020 is now optimized for iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad Pro running iOS 13, as well as on Apple Watch—and you don’t have to pay a single cent more to use the app on these devices, on the new iOS.\n\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later.",

We've tried all the apps that let you do it over WiFi, but they're not fast enough, so we also allow you to use a wired USB connection.\n\nQUALITY VIDEO\nYour iPhone/iPad camera's are good, really good. In fact, there’s no comparison between the highly recommended streaming webcam, the Logitech C922 HD Pro and the iPhone 6 Camera. Stream Landscape or Portrait video.\n\nAUDIO\nIf you don't have a separate mic for your streaming setup, you can now use the microphone on your iOS device to stream audio & video.\n\nFRONT CAMERA\nStream a selfie with the front camera support. Switch anytime during the stream with the familiar camera switch button.\n\nTAP TO FOCUS, PINCH TO ZOOM\nControls just like you're used to from the Camera app.\n\nMANUAL CONTROLS\nTake control of the focus, exposure, white balance as you would on a manual DSLR camera.\n\nLOW LATENCY\nStream video over a wired USB connection. This avoids the issue of delay over wifi, as many other solutions suffer from. This is just as fast as a USB webcam!\n\nUSB & WIFI\nChoose the connection type. If you want low latency, use USB, if you'd like portability then use WiFi. WiFi is done using the NewTek™ NDI® protocol, so you can use Camera for OBS Studio with any NewTek™ NDI® compatible receiver.\n\nMULTIPLE DEVICES\nIf you're lucky enough to own multiple iOS devices, use them together and produce a multi-camera stream.\n\nMAC AND PC\nSupports OBS Studio running on macOS and Windows.\n\nYou will need to install the OBS Studio iOS Camera Plugin from our website, or use an NDI compatible receiver to use this app.\n\nFor the best possible experience make sure you device is listed on our website https://obs.camera/docs/faqs/#what-ios-hardware-do-i-need",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any LG Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your LG TV.\n\nThis works on any LG Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. \n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your LG TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for LG TV app. It will start looking for your LG TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model LG TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for LG TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Mirroring made Easy\" - 5 STARS - by JBGuam\nAbsolutely great app, worked seamlessly with my tv, lag was minimal, but to be fair only receiving 40-45 mbs instead of 100+ mbs in the particular room I tried this. Should be even better with faster internet speeds.\n\n\"Works Great!!\" - 5 STARS - by czerkman\nNot sure why others had problems, I followed the directions and it worked perfectly. Ingenious idea from a developers standpoint.\n\n\"The app works great\" - 5 STARS - by Alivesbg\nNo problems... Good set by step set-up.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen and audio of your iPhone or iPad to an Amazon Fire TV. You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Fire TV.\n\nBefore using this application, please go to the Amazon website and install the (free) Mirror Receiver for Fire TV: http://bit.ly/am-firetv\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 2). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Fire TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Fire TV app. It will start looking for your Fire TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the Fire TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Fire TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\nDRM\nSome apps don't allow screen mirroring. For instance Netflix: when you start screen mirroring when running the Netflix app on your iPhone or iPad, the TV screen will turn black. This is a choice that Netflix made, there is nothing that we can do about that.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved",

Validation published on the Journal of Strength & Conditioning Research and Journal of Sports Sciences*****\n***Featured by Apple under ‘Best New Apps’ in 100+ countries***\n***The only app which calculates the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method***\n \nMy Jump 2 is the first app scientifically developed to measure your jump height. With a great design and validated by sport scientists, My Jump 2 is as reliable as a 10000$ force platform. Scientifically probed!\n\n------------------------------\n \nPierre Samozino (PhD, sport scientist, University of Savoy): “My Jump 2 makes possible the determination of the jump height with a high accuracy, which has been validated in very recent scientific study. The other, and I think the main added value of this app is to propose the determination of the Force-Velocity-Power profile of each athlete and its own imbalance between force and velocity qualities. Very useful to optimize your strength training and improve your explosive performances.”\n\nJean-Benoit Morin (PhD, sport scientist, University of Nice): “My Jump 2 is the cutting edge, scientifically validated and most practical application to measure athletes vertical jumping performance, and the only one to include the complete \"Optimal Force-Velocity Profile\" analysis we recently validated. I'm using it with athletes, students, and research subjects. The entire Jumping Force-Velocity-Power and Optimal F-V Profile approach in your pocket!”\n \n------------------------------\n \nMy Jump 2 gives you advanced information of your jumps using the camera on your iPhone, iPod touch or iPad. Just record a jump, select accurately its take off and landing and lets My Jump do its magic. My Jump 2 calculates the height, flight time, velocity, force and power of your vertical jumps. Also, it gives you the contact time, vertical stiffness and reactive strength index (RSI) of your Drop Jumps. Moreover, it allows you to calculate your Force-Velocity profile using Samozino's method. Complete analysis of your jumps right on your hand!\n \nFEATURES:\n \n• Accurate measurement of your vertical jumps. Scientifically demonstrated!\n• Calculate the force-velocity profile using the groundbreaking Samozino’s method. You can know your maximal theoretical force, velocity, power and how far you are from your optimal capabilities! You can even get information about which quality (force or velocity) you should work to increase your explosive performance.\n• Record stunnig slowmo videos up to 240fps or import as much as you like from your camera roll.\n• Different jump types: countermovement jump (CMJ), squat jump (SJ), drop jump (DJ), CMJ free arms, horizontal jumps and repeated jump test!\n• Annotate the external load used (CMJ & SJ) or the height of the box (DJ) to organize your best performances in different categories.\n• Multi-user. My Jump 2 allows you to create as many users as you want. Monitor all your team on your iDevice!\n• iCloud sync (iOS 13+)\n• History. Record as many jumps as you want for each user created.

The Torrent Detector is the best choice for you. It is an easy-to-use app for detect uTorrent clients. With over 100 million users uTorrent is the most widely used BitTorrent client.\n\nWARNING: This is NOT a torrent client. You can NOT download, upload, open, run, seed or leach torrent file or content with this app. Torrent Discover is designed to search for torrent clients only, especially uTorrent clients. The app doesn't connect to torrent trackers or other content aggregators.\n\nWHAT IS BITTORRENT\nBitTorrent is a protocol for the practice of peer-to-peer file sharing that is used to distribute large amounts of data over the Internet. BitTorrent is one of the most common protocols for transferring large files, and peer-to-peer networks have been estimated to collectively account for approximately 43% to 70% of all Internet traffic. The fact is that peer-to- peer protocols such as BitTorrent provide a very efficient way to distribute large files such as operating system ISOs. Unfortunately that also makes peer-to-peer protocols a very efficient way to download copyright content such as music and movies. Regardless of whether corporate policy prohibits downloading of copyrighted content, or prohibits all peer-to-peer usage, it is essential to be able to detect the various aspects of peer-to-peer usage.\n\nTORRENT CLIENT DETECTION \n• Detect running uTorrent (owned and developed by BitTorrent, Inc) applications. \n• Detect uTorrent version.\n• Detect uTorrent host operating system name and version. Supported uTorrent platforms:\n    • Microsoft Windows platform family (from Windows 95 to Windows 10).\n    • Apple macOS/OS X platform family (from Cheetah to High Sierra).\n    • Linux (Debian, Ubuntu).\n\nHOST INFORMATIONS\n• Show IP address, DNS hostname, PING capability, network informations.\n• Show MAC address, MAC vendor, country, postal address.\n\nINTERNET INFO\n• Show default gateways, IP addresses, networks.\n• Show DNS servers, search domain names, local MAC addresses, host name resolve.\n• Depth external address analysis: ISP name, autonomous system name, whois, ping, regional internet registry info.\n• Full offline MAC vendor database.\n\nREACH UI FEATURES\n• Info menu with feedback and privacy settings\n• Use the camera icon (upper-right corner) to create and print/send/share a screenshot from the entire page.\n• Pull down with your finger to refresh the informations.\n• Long press on a cell to copy/print/send/open as/share the cell value.\n• Shake your device to refresh the informations.\n\nDEVICE INFO\n• Detect device type and model.\n• Detect processor type.\n• Detect memory size.\n• Detect storage size.\n• Detect firmware name, version.\n• Detect last reboot time.",

You can choose to use any or all of the bets, and the Golf Accountant will automatically calculate the results as quickly as you enter the scores.\n\nAfter each hole, enter each players score, along with any dots, snakes or Bingo Bingo Bongo for the hole and the app will automatically calculate the win/loss statement for each player on the results tab. You can access the results tab at anytime should a player want to know their current status.\n\nThe results tab produces individual win/loss statements for each player, as well as a breakdown within individual bets. The app lets you easily switch between pages, and you can always return to the bet page to change, add or delete specific bets.\n\nI was always the designated accountant in our group. When the match was over, I would spend considerable time tallying up the different bets\n\nI figured there had to be a better way, and began building a spreadsheet that would quickly and accurately calculate each individual player’s Win/Loss amount. Over the past few years, the spreadsheet grew as bets and complexity were added. The goal was to get a spreadsheet that calculated every bet automatically, as quickly as you enter the scores.\n\nOnce the spreadsheet was finished, I decided to put it in app format to make life easier for the other golf accountants.\n\nThe result is a great calculator, without advertising, and full functionality at a great price. This app allows other golf accountants to be done as they walk off the 18th green. The Golf Accountant app has an option to email the scores and win/loss results to each player for record keeping.\n\nIf you are not the accountant in the group, now you can be. Or at a minimum, you can check the accountant’s work!\n\nHope you download and enjoy the App. \n\nGolf Accountant",

This app was developed by popular demand after wide success on other operating systems.\n\nThis app allows users to \"page\" (prompt an animation to play on receiving devices) nearby devices that also have the app open, safely simulating the function of Dokk OS for the purposes of: casual fun, competitive themed airsoft, cosplaying, making fan films, and any other similar activities.\n\nUpon launch, the app automatically begins finding and connecting to nearby devices that also have the app open. These connections (if any) will be listed in the central area of the user interface. The user can highlight these devices to select them as recipients for paging.\nWhen a user presses the \"page\" button (the tall one located on the righthand side), the highlighted devices will open and play an animation until the screen is tapped three times quickly. If the middle-top checkbox is checked, it will also play the animation on the sending user's device. The app will not connect to or communicate with other devices that do not also have the app installed and open.\nPressing the \"cams\" button (the other enabled button on the righthand side) will run another short animation only on that device.\nThe left and right switches along the top are only for visual accuracy and do not hold any relevance to the functionality of the app.",

The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength.

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",

This was inspired by TrueCrypt and makes brute force attacks longer. The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher, key size or cipher mode of operation.\n• Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\n• The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\n• Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.\n\nFor more info see http://www.awallet.org/\n\nIf you like this App, rate it in the App Store.

    "description": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable.

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "“[A] surprising iPhone and Apple Watch bestseller is pushing the boundaries of fiction” - boingboing.net\n“This is the best game on the Apple Watch” - Time.com\n\nLifeline is a playable, branching story of survival against all odds. Using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, you will help Taylor make life or death decisions, and face the consequences together.\n\nAcclaimed writer Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) weaves a gripping interactive story through the aftermath of a crash landing on an alien moon. Taylor is stranded, the rest of the crew are dead or missing, and Taylor’s communicator can only reach you. \n\nA totally unique experience enabled by modern devices, this story plays out in real time. As Taylor works to stay alive, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Taylor directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.\n\nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and see what happens when you make a different choice. Simple actions can have a profound effect. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n\nLifeline is a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes. Taylor is relying on YOU.\n\nNEW in version 1.8: Stick around after the game for a special story epilogue from Dave Justus. For players who have already finished the game, the Sneak Peek becomes available under the game options. Enjoy!\n\nInternet connection not required. No in-app purchases and no ads.\n\nWATCH US: http://www.youtube.com/c/LifelineGame\n\nPraise for Lifeline:\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“I felt an immediate attachment to a fictional character pinging me from a strange galaxy to my wearable.” - Luke Hopewell, Gizmodo Australia\n\n“[P]laying it on the Apple Watch makes you truly feel like you’re exchanging messages with an astronaut via a futuristic transmitter.” - Michael Andronico, Tom’s Guide\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\n\nLifeline was created by:\nDave Justus\nMars Jokela\nDan Selleck\nColin Liotta\nJason Nowak\nBen “Books” Schwartz",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat. Also their support is brilliant, they responded in less than an hour of the query I emailed to them.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "Have you ever wondered what it’s like to land the Space Shuttle? Now you can find out. F-Sim Space Shuttle is a critically acclaimed flight simulator for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It simulates the Space Shuttle approach and landing in incredible detail and accuracy. We’ve tried to combine realistic flight dynamics with stunning graphics and fun game play: Each landing attempt takes just a few minutes. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again.\n\nNo ads, no in-app-purchases.\n\nEach flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. Landing the Orbiter takes practice, but the built-in autopilot demo and tutorials will get you started. After your first safe touchdown,  chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different weather conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles. \n\nYou control the Orbiter’s pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we’ve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they’ll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it’s your turn to give it a try.\n\nHere’s what others have said about it:\n\n“Because this app is so visually exciting, so technically deep, so sophisticated, so beautifully done in its realism, effects, and documentation, it earned a perfect 5/5 rating, Outstanding.”\nJohn Martellaro, Senior Editor for Reviews, The Mac Observer\n\n“I was excited to see that I can enjoy flying the space shuttle realistically also on my iPhone and complement my addiction to our Space Shuttle Mission Simulator on PC when I am on the road.”\nAlex L., www.space-shuttle-mission.com\n\n“Absolutely awesome app that is a must for shuttle huggers and aspiring astronauts.”\nChris Bergin, Managing Editor, NASASpaceflight.com\n\nF-Sim Space Shuttle takes full advantage of modern iOS devices, but also runs smoothly on older hardware. We’ve tested it on all iOS devices, and iOS versions 3 to 7.",

You don't need a computers and expensive software to superimpose or blend/mix/combine/cut/copy/paste one photo on top of another any more.\n\nHere is how it works...\n\n1. Load a background image.\n2. Load a foreground image.\n3. Mask out unwanted portion of the foreground image using wide range of masking tools.\n4. Smoothen the edges with smoothen tool inside the app, if required.\n5. Move, Scale, Resize, Rotate, Flip the foreground to place it on the right location on the background image.\n6. Adjust the colors/exposure/contrast/hue/saturation etc. of the foreground and the background images if required to match both the images in terms of colors.\n7. You are done! Save the blended image to the photo library at full resolution or share it on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nYou can also use this tool to do serious photo editing tasks like blending textures or overlaying borders or to do double exposure with adjustable transparency and 18 blending modes.\n\nMasking in the app is the most powerful one available on the app store, just tap on an area of the photo, and the app will mask out all the connected area with similar colors. Or you can use brush, lasso, polygon, global color similarity, rectangle, ellipse, linear, bi-linear, radial gradient, mask from image, mask from text, magic mask and hair refine masking tools. Mask an area with this tool and that area of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.\n\nYou can even drop a shadow of the foreground onto the background.",
