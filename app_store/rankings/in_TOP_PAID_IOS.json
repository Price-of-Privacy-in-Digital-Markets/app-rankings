    "description": "We are @moment and Pro Camera is the app we’ve always wanted. Manual controls, better video, long exposure and quick access to the settings we need. It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.\n\nFor Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR. Shoot in RAW (even in BURST), split focus / exposure, and manually control everything (exposure, iso, shutter speed, white balance and focus).\n\nFor Everyone Else - inspired by the pro’s we made the interface simple, fast, and easy to use. We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you. If you have any features, ideas, or feedback please email us at hello@shopmoment.com or DM us on Instagram @moment.\n\n## Premium Features\n+ NEW Timelapse mode - capture stunning time-lapse videos.\n+ Slow Shutter mode - long exposure shots with motion blur and light trails.\n\n## Photography Features\n+ Focus peaking - the green edges will help you dial in your focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ RAW and TIFF - Shoot photos in RAW format for better editing, or TIFF for high-quality printing.\n+ Split Focus and Exposure - Take control of tricky lighting scenarios.\n+ Full Manual - Control shutter speed, iso, exposure, focus, and white balance with easy to use sliders and double taps to reset.\n+ Burst mode - Capture burst shots in RAW format. This is big as now you can capture action with burst but at the uncompressed quality pros want with RAW.\n+ HEIF and HEVC - Seamless support for the latest Apple file formats across photos and videos.\n\n## Filmmaker Features\n+ Focus peaking - the yellow edge glow will help you find dial in the focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ Color Profiles - Select from default, flat, or log color profiles to get the most out of your files in post-processing.\n+ Video Bitrates - Get precise control over video quality with standard, medium, and high bitrates to choose from.\n+ RGB Histogram: Dial in your video color, balance, and exposure with a live RGB histogram.\n+ Waveform monitor - Evaluate video brightness and exposure across your image in real time.\n+ Audio meters - Get just the right sound levels with real-time, precise, dual-channel (when available) audio levels.\n+ Live Histogram - Get your exposure right every time.\n+ Video Stabilization - Make your videos buttery smooth.\n+ Precise Video - Change your resolution and frame rate on screen, without digging into a settings menu.\n+ Anamorphic - Use the Moment Anamorphic lens to shoot amazing, letterbox style photos and videos.\n\n## Works With\n+ Triple/Dual Lens Control - Manually control which side of the triple/dual lens you want to shoot with so you can use Moment lenses over either one.\n+ Moment Lens - select which lens you are shooting with.\n+ Moment Battery Case - Works with the DSLR-like shutter button on our photography cases for half-press and full-press capture. Take better photos, faster.\n+ Apple Watch - Use your watch as a remote to shoot photos or record videos.\n+ Siri Shortcuts - Quick access to capture a photo or start a video\n\nRAW and 3D shutter require an iPhone 6S or later (6S, 7, 8, X, XS, XR, SE)",

    "description": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals.",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "\"If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you.\" - , 9/10, Pocket Gamer UK\n\n\"This War of Mine isn’t exactly “fun,” but it’s definitely a game worth playing.\" , 9/10, 148apps\n\n\"I'm really excited to go home and download 11 bit studios' title on my iPad\" , Game Informer\n\nIn This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n\nThis War of Mine: Anniversary Edition\nIt's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? \n\nKey Features:\n• Inspired by real-life events \n• Control your survivors and manage your shelter \n• Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive \n• Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience \n• Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game \n• Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\n\nThis War of Mine experience is now broadened with \"The Little Ones\" expansion. \"The Little Ones\" explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.\n\n• Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine\n• Protect innocent children\n• Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need\n• Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is optimized for latest devices. While playing on older devices such as iPhone 4s or iPad 2 you might experience lower frame rates.",

    "description": "Recommended and shared by thousands of users! Mentioned as the iOS app to use in:\n  ◆  wired.com - How to Sweep For Bugs and Hidden Cameras\nNote that the app is just a helper tool to induce lens reflection and should be used with common sense and manual inspection of the target object.\n \nProtect your privacy from spy hidden camera lenses. Here are some actual news headlines:\n  ◆  Brits staying in Airbnb flat 'find spy camera hidden pointed at bed'\n  ◆  Oil rig worker files lawsuit: I was secretly recorded\n  ◆  Motel manager accused of setting up hidden camera\n  ◆  Models find hidden cameras in apartment\n\nA free do-it-yourself way of detecting cameras from instructables.com, also based on detecting lens reflections:\n  ◆  Step 1: Find a tube that's good for looking through. A cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper or paper towels is best.\n  ◆  Step 2: All you need is a flashlight or something that you can use to focus a beam of light in a dark room. Attaching a couple of directional LEDs to the outside of the cardboard tube can work also if you don't have a flashlight.\n  ◆  Step 3: With one hand, hold up the toilet paper tube to your eye. With your other hand, hold up the flashlight at about eye level and point it away from you. With one eye, look through the tube and scan the room. If there are any small points of light bouncing back, inspect it further. It might be a camera.\n\nThis app is a tool to help you detect disguised camera lens that you suspect are present in a room. The manual mode with overlay is already equivalent to the do-it-yourself described above or the more expensive hardware camera detector gadgets that tries to detect using the tell-tale signs of tiny reflections of hidden camera lenses. The good thing is this app is always with you, ready when you need it.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS for the APP: \n\nUse this tool after your own visual inspection and investigation. Scan the room first without your phone and once you find something suspicious point the phone camera to the suspected object. The app alternately turns on and off the camera flash to detect the signature of a camera lens. Carefully adjusting the distance and angle relative to the target object helps as well adjusting the level of lighting in the room.\n\nWhen automatic mode is ineffective or distracting you should use manual mode. In both manual and automatic modes you must use your own judgment as this is just a tool like what you would do with an expensive hidden camera detector gadgets or the do-it-yourself detector described above.\n\nMANUAL Detection: \nAnytime that you see the signature of a camera lens you can single-tap on the screen and put a marker on the suspected camera lens.\nYellow overlay - this signifies that the surface might be metallic or glass-like and that a great amount of reflectivity is being detected.\nCyan overlay - this means that the surface is changing in color consistent with the general hue of camera lenses.\n\nAUTOMATIC Detection: \nThe app will continuously try its best to put a marker where it assesses a camera lens may be present. To exclude surfaces that are generating lots of false positives you can zoom the camera or carefully change the distance or angle of the phone to the target. Works best when room lights are dimmed and the phone is very steady.\n\nBONUS 1: EMF scanner to detect the slight magnetic field present in electronic devices including hidden spy cameras. \nBONUS 2: Some home cameras broadcast bluetooth information and this app has a scanner for bluetooth devices.\n\nBE SAFE and START SCANNING!",

    "description": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

    "description": "A worldwide App Store Editors’ Choice. “Stunningly poignant - and quite brilliant. 10/10.” - Eurogamer\n\n“Ki” is the Iñupiaq word for “Let’s Go!”, and now you can play the award-winning indie hit on the go with Never Alone: Ki Edition.\n\nNever Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) is an atmospheric puzzle platformer developed in collaboration with the Iñupiat, an Alaska Native people, drawn from a traditional story that has been shared across the generations. Experience the epic journey of Nuna and Fox as they search for the source of an eternal blizzard that threatens the survival of everything they have ever known. \n\nGuide both characters as you trek through frozen tundra, leap across treacherous ice floes, swim through underwater caverns and face enemies both strange and familiar.\n\nOn over 75 \"Best of 2014\" lists and winner of \"Best Debut Game\" at the 2015 BAFTA Games Awards as well as \"Game of the Year\" and \"Most Significant Impact\" at the 2015 Games for Change Awards, nearly 40 Alaska Native elders, storytellers and community members contributed to the making of Never Alone. \n\nYou'll explore awe-inspiring environments, perform heroic deeds and meet legendary characters from Iñupiaq stories — all narrated by a master storyteller in the spoken Iñupiaq language.\n\nFeatures\n\nReimagined for mobile -- Never Alone: Ki Edition includes every level and all the excitement of the original game enjoyed by millions of PC and console players around the world. We’ve updated the game for mobile devices, adding brand-new touch controls, menus and hints along with optimized graphics and AI that bring the beauty of Never Alone’s ethereal, arctic environments to phones and tablets.\n\nPlay as both Nuna and Fox — switch between the two companions at any time as you rely on the unique skills of each character to succeed in your quest. Nuna can climb ladders and ropes, move heavy obstacles, and throw her bola at targets to solve puzzles. Fox can fit through small areas that Nuna can't reach, scramble up walls, and jump to great heights. \n\nExplore the harsh world of the Arctic — run under, through, and atop the unstable structures of an abandoned coastal village. Explore the eerily quiet treetops of a mysterious, frozen forest. Brave the fierce winds of the eternal blizzard. Only with the aid of Helping Spirits will Nuna and Fox have any chance of survival in a land where survival seems impossible. \n\nUnlock fascinating video insights — Elders, storytellers, and other members of the Alaska Native community share stories and wisdom about their culture, values and the amazing Arctic world encountered by players in over 30 minutes of interviews.\n\nCustomizable controls — Adjust the sensitivity or select an alternate layout for the game’s onscreen controls.  For those who prefer a physical controller, the game also supports MFi devices.\n\nSupport for 17 languages — Chinese (Simplified), Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Spanish (European/Latin America) and Swedish.",

    "description": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget, which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/",

    "description": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.",

I bet this app will make you smile or laugh at least once.\n\nMy name is Vince Kotchian, and I've been a GRE prep tutor since 2008.

Each vocab flashcard has a silly cartoon, a clear definition of the word with an example sentence, and a memorable mnemonic to make it easier to remember the word. \n\nHere's a mnemonic example so you know what I'm talking about: \"prodigal\" means \"wasteful\". The prodigal Prada gal spent $1500 on a pair of Prada boots. Get it? :)\n\nThe app's smart spaced repetition system shows you words when you need to review them to make your GRE vocabulary studying more efficient and effective. There's also a streak feature to help keep you motivated to use the app consistently.

    "description": "Find the right word wherever you go. The official RhymeZone iOS app is a fast, powerful rhyming dictionary and thesaurus that you can use anywhere, even if you're not on the net. Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes, synonyms, antonyms,  homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context).\n\nYou get a database of way over 100,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an internet connection, but if you are on the net when you use the app, it can connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love. Or you can look it up using your phone's dictionaries, or on our sister site, OneLook.com. You can even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea! This feature is experimental; registered users of the app will get free upgrades as they become available.\n\nSo whether you're looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!",

    "description": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass).",

The counter can also be changed quickly with a swipe gesture.\n\nThis counter works without any advertising and there are no in-app purchases or subscriptions. Pay once, always use.\n\nIf you want to look like someone from the future among your friends, this animated app - reminiscent of spacey HUDs from science fiction movies - is just right for you!\n\nWho needs this app?\n\nClickers or tally counters are usually used when you want to count cars on certain sections of the road or people (e.g. maximum number of visitors to amusement park ride). In addition, these counters are also useful tools for scientific research or counting inventory in shops. But also in sports you may want to record fast-speed repetitions such as jumping rope or the number of points.",

You can even use Outdoor Run++ to track your driving path. \n\nOutdoor Run++ gives you the capability to see the distance, pace, and speed measurements in both miles and kilometers units. You can easily switch between the two units even in the middle of a workout with a swipe on the distance label. \n\nOutdoor Run++ saves a map of the path you have traveled and shows you mile or kilometer markers. You can use the \"Mark\" button to mark certain locations on your path so that you can check the distance and time it took you to get to that mark. \n\nOutdoor Run++ has the capability to track multi-section workouts. You can use \"Start\", \"Pause\", and \"Resume\" sequence to track your multi-section workout. In the workout summary you will see each section of your workout under \"Workout Splits\".\n\nHealthKit Access: You can choose to grant access to Outdoor Run++ to read \"Date of Birth\", \"Sex\", \"Weight\", and \"Height\" information from your Health app (HealthKit). These data points are solely used for calorie calculations. Therefore if you choose not to grant permission to Outdoor Run++ to access your health data all the functionality of Outdoor Run++ is intact except for calorie calculations. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us for any questions, comments, to report any bugs, or to suggest additional features you would like to see in the upcoming updates.",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

Otherwise flying will only be a dream once again.\n\nTiny Wings was chosen as the iPhone Game of the Year in App Store Rewind 2011 in Europe and many other countries. Thank you Apple and a big thank you to all Tiny Wings fans!\n\nHighlights: \n• simple \"one button\" (ok... maybe \"one tap\") arcade game about the dream of flying \n• the world is changing every day - so it does in this game! Procedural generated graphics will make \"tiny wings\" look different every day you play\n • Two game modes: \"Day Trip\" and \"Flight School\"\n• iPad only: Split screen multiplayer!\n• upgrade your nest by fulfilling tasks\n• Play as the mama bird or one of her four children\n• 30 hand-designed levels in the new \"Flight School\" mode\n• iCloud support (even syncs your game between the iPhone & iPad versions)",

All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.\n\n\n\n\n\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money.
