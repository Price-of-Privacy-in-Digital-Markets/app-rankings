Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength. All this data appears on the dash and can be managed with the mode switch, keeping your hands where they belong: on the handlebar.",

    "description": "A unique tool for teaching and learning the top 100 most teachable topics in internal medicine\n\nThere are many challenges for residents when training students who are making the big \"jump\" from preclinical to clinical. Most notably, they need to find time to pick and prepare topics to teach in meaningful ways without the availability of a blackboard in the learning hospital. Students also need to quickly be able to grasp these concepts quickly and with the ability to recall them later. This teaching manual primarily focuses on physiology/pathophysiology/exam findings with the goal of providing content to make teaching and learning on the wards easier for both attendings/senior residents and interns/medical students. It features the 100 most teachable topics (clinical pearls) in an image-based presentation and will cover all the major disciplines of internal medicine, including cardiology, gastroenterology, endocrine, and infectious disease.\n\nEach topic, or card, has an image on one side to prompt discussion (ECG, CXR, physical exam finding, etc.), and the flip side includes teaching points organized in question and answer format. They are presented in a pocket-sized binder with removable cards so both residents and students can remove only the topics of the day or ones they need to study.\n\nFeatures:\n• Each topic area has been reviewed by a specialist at Harvard Medical School.\n• Visual, easy-to-use and reference tool for on-the-go\n• Discusses the \"why\" behind a teachable topic\n• Q&A format serves both rotation and exam prep\n• Case-based to practice clinical pearls and complex topics\n\nThis app is very intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing you to browse the contents or search for topics. The powerful search tool gives you word suggestions that appear in the text as you type, so it is lightning fast and helps with spelling those long medical terms. The search tool also keeps a recent history of past search terms so you can go back to a previous search result very easily. You have the ability to create notes, and bookmark cards as Know or Don't Know to help with studying. There is also a Random tab to quiz yourself on a randomly selected card. You can also change the text size for easier reading.\n\nAfter the app has been downloaded, no internet connection is needed to retrieve the content of the app. All of the text and images are available to you on your device anytime, anywhere, and lightning fast. This app is also automatically optimized for whatever size device you are currently using, either phone or tablet. \n\nCheck out https://usatinemedia.com to learn more and watch a video demo of this app.\n\nThis interactive app contains the full content of Teaching Rounds: A Visual Aid to Teaching Internal Medicine Pearls on the Wards by McGraw-Hill Education.\n\nAuthors:\nNavin Kumar, MD\nClinical Fellow, Medicine\nDivision of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Endoscopy\nBrigham and Women's Hospital\nResearch Fellow in Medicine\nHarvard Medical School\n\nAnica Law, MD\nClinical Fellow, Medicine\nDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine\nBeth Israel Deaconess and Massachusetts General Hospital\nResearch Fellow in Medicine\nHarvard Medical School\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is intended for the education of healthcare professionals and not as a diagnostic and treatment reference for the general population. \n\n\nDeveloped by Usatine Media \nRichard P.

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "ICU Trials is a quick pocket reference for both the novice and seasoned critical care clinician. This app does not replace the original manuscript of these landmark critical care trials – instead, it serves as a fast reference and learning tool for some of the most important ICU trials over a wide range of specialties.\n\nEach entry contains a short one-liner about the critical care trial and key points, which includes only the most pertinent details, such as inclusion/exclusion criteria, treatment protocols, pertinent endpoints and findings, as well as expert commentary regarding key subgroup analyses or limitations to the trial.\n\nWant to send a colleague a citation? Use the \"Share Trial\" button to send a PubMed link and quick summary. Using this feature, it’s incredibly easy to share pivotal critical care trials with students, residents, and other colleagues.\n\nThe database features 100+ landmark trials related to: ARDS, cardiac arrest, DVT/PE, delirium, glycemic control, heart failure, hemorrhage, meningitis, nephroprotection, nutrition, pneumonia, sedation, seizure, sepsis/shock, spinal cord injury, stroke, and subarachnoid hemorrhage – with more trials and topics to be added on a regular basis!\n\nThis app is designed and maintained by Sean P. Kane, PharmD, BCPS -- a clinical pharmacist specializing in critical care with a background in information technology and application development.",

These values can be selected as fixed basic values or saved values from the previous session. To change a value, first tap on the property's field to enable the property. Upon activation, the field lights up in a preset bright color. At the bottom of the screen, a keypad for input of the same color lights up. The keypad can be chosen to be for absolute or for incremental input of values and is adapted to current property. Switching between the different keypads is done with a long tap on a value field.\nIn conjunction with activation of a property, in most cases, some other value fields are also lit in a darker color to indicate that their values will also change.\nWith a quick double tap on a value's field a brief description and a descriptive image of current property can be obtained. The same thing happens when you double tap the result field on page 2, but all results are described in a scrollable image.\n\n\nPage 1 is used for input and calculation of cutting data, surface fineness and cutting time. Page 1 manages itself and is NOT DEPENDENT on page 2.\nPage 2, on the other hand, is dependent on page 1 and is used for further data entry and calculations.\n\n\nTREATED VALUES ON PAGE 1\n\n- Diameter\n- Cutting length\n- Cutting speed\n- Spindle speed\n- Feed per revolution\n- Feed per minute\n- Tip radius\n- Surface\n- Time\n\n\nINPUT VALUES ON PAGE 2\n\n- Processing type\n- Cutting depth\n- Entering angle\n- Specific cutting force (kc)\n   · Material\n   · Rake angle\n- Efficiency\n\n\nRESULTING VALUES ON PAGE 2\n\n- Material removal   (volume and rate)\n- Chip thicknesses   (max and average (equivalent))\n- Cutting forces   (tangential, axial and radial)\n- Torque   (spindle)\n- Power   (spindle and motor)",

However, I miss the beautifully blurred background and bokeh effects that I can get using my DSLR camera. 'Bokeh Lens' for iOS will let you make the subject in your photo stand out by making the background blurred with natural-looking bokeh effects through the easy editing process.\n\nSelecting the foreground area (area to be remaining as sharp) is the key factor to get the best possible result. The selection tool in this app was designed and developed to meet your detail-oriented editing needs. It will display a loupe (magnifying glass) when you zoom-in and try to select/deselect area. The loupe is very handy because otherwise you can't see the spot you're touching as your finger is blocking your view.\n\nYou can also adjust bokeh level (aperture) to control how much your photo's background should be bokeh-blurred.\n\nHere are the reasons why you should get Bokeh Lens today:\n- Great result with bokeh-blurred background\n- Easy to use\n- Awesome selection tool\n- Delightful experience\n\nPlease enjoy the experience and don't hesitate to share your bokelicious photos!  \n\nResult image samples can be found in our Flickr group. Please join our Flickr group:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/bokehliciousapp\n\nand follow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/BokehLens\n\nUse hashtag #bokehlens when you share your photos,\n\nand give us your feedback at:\nhttp://bokehlens.uservoice.com",

    "description": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

    "description": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com",

    "description": "RevMeter Pro measures the reverberation time of a room.\nBurst and interrupted modes are supported. Because the dynamic range of the\niPhone microphone (30dB - 100dB) is too low to get 60dB dynamic RevMeter Pro supports only the RT30 and RT20 method.\nRevMeter Pro also lets you send the measured results by eMail for later analysis. In addition screenshots \nmay be saved to the iPhoto album.\n\nDefinition of Reverberation Time:\nThe Reverberation Time RT60 is defined as the time required for reflections of a \ndirect sound to decay by 60 dB below the level of the direct sound. As it is usually very\ndifficult to achieve a dynamic range of 60dB two more methods have been established. They\nare called RT30 and RT20. The measured time is the multiplied by 2, respectively 3 to\ncompute the RT60 time.\n\nMeasuring the reverberation time:\nHistorically reverberation time could only be measured using a level recorder \n(a plotting device which graphs the noise level against time on a ribbon of moving paper). \nA loud noise is produced, and as the sound dies away the trace on the level recorder will show a \ndistinct slope. Analysis of this slope reveals the measured reverberation time. Modern digital \nsound level meters can carry out this analysis automatically. \nTwo basic methods exist for creating a sufficiently loud noise (which must have a defined cut off point). \nImpulsive noise sources such as a blank pistol shot, or balloon burst may be used to measure the \nimpulse response of a room. Alternatively, a random noise signal such as pink noise or \nwhite noise may be generated through a loudspeaker, and then turned off. \nThis is known as the interrupted method, and the measured result is known as the interrupted response.\n\nDisclaimer:\nEven though the RevMeter Pro Software has been calibrated using professional grade equipment, do no use RevMeter Pro \nto carry out professional measurements. The author can not be held liable for any damage which might arise by using RevMeter Pro.",

    "description": "The Panchang is ancient spiritual and scientific calendar system based on the positions of the planets, the sun and moon. One year is composed of 12 lunar months of around 29 days and 12 hours.\n\nFor every year, our panchang contains more than 340 important date of events and holy festivals in India. It reflects India's culture through the Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian and civil festivals happening all along the year. Nearly all the festivals are illustrated with a colorful image.\n\nThe calendar covers the full 2021 year. It also contains all the information from year 2009.\n\nIt contains all the details about the lunar cycles (Tithi and Karana), the planets (Nakshatra), the moon/sun combinaisons (Yoga), the full moons or purnima, the new moon or amavasaya, ... along with the Sunrise and Sunset timings.\n\nWhat's included:\n- Sun, Thithi and Nakshatra timings for several cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata) and around the World: Paris, London, Geneva, Moscow,New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, Los Angeles, Cape Town, Toronto, Melbourne, Sydney, Tokoy, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Hawaii, St Denis Réunion, Kuweit City, Colombo, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur. The timings are taking the daylight savings into account.\n Panchak for every month\n- At startup, the current month will be displayed, with an emphasis on the current day. Just clic on any day to get all the details about this particular day.\n- Lunar month days\n- Display the details on a day, including: western calendar information (gregorian calendar), Tithi information (moon day name, Shuklapaksh, Krishnapaksh, timings), Nakshatra (name and timings), Sun timings, list of festivals of that day\n- Display Vikram Samwat and Saka Samwat\n- A list of full moon (purnima) and new moon (amavasaya)\n- A list of events and holy festivals, sorted by months, with direct access to any month.\n- A list of government gazetted holidays\n- A very convenient search tool: Just type a word or the part of a word and get the list of all events related to your search.\n- An image for nearly every event\n- A list of major cities for which you want to see the detailed panchang. If your city is not in the list, you just select the closest one.\n\nWith the search tool, you can:\n- Write \"Prad\", you'll get the full list of Pradosh vrat of the year (worship of Lord Shiva, which is observed on the Trayodashi of both the fortnight - Shukla and Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Eka\", you'll get the full list of Ekadashi of the year (Ekadashi occurs on the 11th day of the bright half - called Shukla Paksha and on the 11th of the dark half called Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Chatur\", you'll get the full list of Ganesha and Vinayak Chaturthi of the year\n- Write \"Rohini\" or \"Ashtami\", and so on...\n\nOur calendar complied a Hindu Panchang according to Vedic science and modern outlook. We did a deep study to give you accurate information. We are still improving our panchang and updating the event's list.\n\nLiability Exclusion: We make every effort to ensure, but do not guarantee, the accuracy of the information on this calendar. None of us shall be in any way liable vis-a-vis any person for any damage of any kind or for any cost or expense resulting from the use of the contents of this calendar.
