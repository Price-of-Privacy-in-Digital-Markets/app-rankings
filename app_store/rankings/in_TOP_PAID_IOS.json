    "description": "DoubleTake by FiLMiC transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nDoubleTake gives you an early look at the multi-cam capability that will be coming to our award-winning cinema camera app FiLMiC Pro.  \n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll.",

Play with friends or strangers in online play, challenge the AI, or play offline with friends face-to-face! \r\n\r\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t​he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens. \r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\r\n\r\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\r\n\r\n- Featuring original art by The Oatmeal\r\n\r\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\r\n \r\n- Digital versions of the hit expansions, including Streaking and Barking Kittens, as well as digital exclusive Betrayal and Party decks\r\n\r\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\r\n\r\nCreat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\r\n\r\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money.

You don't need to install a big media server like Plex or any other third party software.\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* To enable video casting please open the LG App Store (LG Smart World / LG Content Store) on your TV, search for 'TV Cast' and install the companion app.\n\n* Please enter the ip-address of your iPhone/iPad by using the number pad and up/down/left/right keys on your TV Remote or scroll wheel on your Magic Remote. Just enter the numbers, no need to press the enter key.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* Please test your favorite videos with the free edition before upgrading!\n\n* Please use the hardware remote of your LG for controlling the TV app and video playback.\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a specific video is not working, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible.\n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: Use the Playbar for advanced video control while browsing, including video scrubbing, forward, rewind, play, pause, stop. The playbar works on all LG Smart TVs. \n\n* Local Videos: Cast your camera roll videos from an iPhone or iPad. Supports mp4, m4v and mov videos that were saved to the camera roll via Apples SD-Card/USB Adapter, iTunes Desktop Software or third party apps.\n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with LG Electronics or any other trademark mentioned here.",

    "description": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 12 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase.",

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "Turn-by-turn navigation on your bikes dashboard has been introduced for the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S and R (MY 18,19 &20), the KTM 790 ADVENTURE (MY19 &20), the KTM 390 ADVENTURE (MY20) as well as KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE GT (MY19 & 20) & KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE R (MY20) (Owners of 2017 KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S & R can also benefit by having the cost-free software upgrade installed and activated at an official KTM dealer.).\n\nConnecting a Bluetooth-enabled Smartphone means more than just co-ordinates and directions. Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength. All this data appears on the dash and can be managed with the mode switch, keeping your hands where they belong: on the handlebar.",

    "description": "Hey you! Yeah you! Shouldn't you be looking for Camera+ 2 instead? Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots.",

    "description": "Apart from the most reliable app for polar alignment (with or without a polar scope), PS Align pro has become the astronomer's swiss-army knife with all the tools added over the years. Remember, all features & updates are free forever, the only in-app purchases are donations (tip jar).\n\nPolar Scope Align will calculate the position of Polaris or σ Octantis in your Polar Scope reticle for your location (using your phone's GPS or manually), allowing a quick and accurate polar alignment. It is one of the few programs that are accurate in lower latitudes by correcting for atmospheric refraction (so expect results to agree only with precise software and not most simplistic \"polar align\" apps - see the \"Accuracy\" section in help for details). In the settings you can select the polar scope reticle that matches your own, from a vast collection:\niOptron old & new, Astro-Physics RAPAS & PASILL, various versions of Takahashi EM-10/11/200/400/500, NJP, PM-1, P2-Z, the latest Orion / Skywatcher, the Classic Skywatcher / Orion / Celestron / Meade / EXOS2 / Bresser, the Telrad, Rigel QuikFinder, a couple for Astrotrac / Losmandy / Kenko / Avalon, the Vixen PF-L/Atlux/SX/SXD/SXP/AXD/GP/GP-DX/Polarie Polar Axis Scopes, a Konus and several Polar Finders: Tuthill, Explore Scientific 8x50, Meade 9x60, Vixen Polaris, Celestron 7x50, Carton Optical. PoleMaster help view for South Hemisphere users. If you have one not included, just ask the developer to add it!\n\nFeature list:\n\n-Accurate calculation of Polaris or Sigma Oct for any date and location, including effect of atmospheric refraction (and annual aberration, nutation). Most other apps do not perform precision calculations, so please only compare app readings to accurate sources (USNO, scientific software etc).\n-Use device time/date/location, or enter your own, or pick from online & offline world databases via the Location Manager.\n-Approximate daytime / no polarscope polar alignment tool. Great for visual use, solar imaging (inc. eclipses) and even limited short focal length astrophotography. Now with sun shadow calibration for more accuracy!\n-Laser / Hop Align for nighttime alignment using a calibration star for obstructed or not visible polar star, or for improving laser align.\n-Full app in red-color (or alternative green, white) night mode - tools switchable to daytime view.\n-Deep Space Object (DSO) Database with 22000+ objects from several catalogs (Messier, Caldwell, NGC, IC, Herschell 400, Sharpless 2, Barnard), along with stars (Yale Bright Star) & planets. Search, apply filters, sorting, download DSS color images for all items, or get help finding them with your non-goto telescope with the Push-To function.\n-Connect to and control WiFi-enabled iOptron mounts.\n-Over 30 calculators useful for observing and astrophotography, from eyepiece magnification and field of view, to imaging resolution and reducers.\n-Xasteria: World astro-weather report based on 7Timer! data\n-Water vapor satellite images.\n-List of visible ISS and bright satellite passes.\n-Moon phase & lunar Calendar with solar/lunar rise/set and twilight times.\n-Wizard to calculate your reticle centering offset and correct or compensate for it.\n-Zoomable reticle view and customized routines & tools: Alt-az alignment error display for mounts that calculate it after star alignment (e.g. iOptron iEQ45, CEM60), polar alignment when your scope is not in zero position (for mounts like iOptron ZEQ/CEM on which you can always access the polar scope), remember zero position on Celestron / Skywatcher / Orion etc reticles.\n-Bubble level (using either gyro or accelerometer) and Compass heading, as well as magnetic declination reading.\n-GPS accuracy & elevation data.\n-Red/White/LED light.\n-Dimming slider.\n-iOptron, NexStar and Meade LX200 Star Lists.\n-Support for iPhone & iPad from iOS 9 (and iPod Touch, except tools that require the compass).",

    "description": "Do you enjoy watching videos on your iPhone? Do you hate not being able to because your iPhone cannot support the video format? Or do you hate the inconvenient and time-consuming hassle of trying to convert video formats to fit into one that your iPhone can support? \nThis is why the AVPlayer was created. The AVPlayer can play almost any computer video file format such as AVI, Xvid, WMV and much more clearly and effortlessly. No converting hassles. Just copy files via USB and just drag and drop into the AVPlayer’s Media Explorer. \nThe AVPlayer can also support external subtitle files such as SMI and SRT. So if you enjoy watching videos on your iPad, then the AVPlayer is an absolute necessity. \n\n• Support Formats\n- Dolby Digital (AC3), Dolby Digital Plus (EAC3)\n- Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- MP4,MOV,M4V\n- XVID,AVI,WMV,RMVB,ASF,H264,MKV… most of all movie file formats. \n- SMI, SRT, TXT, SubStationAlpha Subtitles \n\n• Post Processing \n- High quality video processing \n- Contrast,Saturation,Brightness \n- TV-Out \n\n• Control the playback speed (From 0.5X to 2.0X) \n- User setting support \n- Sweep to the left : move to backword 10 sec \n- Sweep to the right : move to forward 10 sec \n- Sweep to the top : 1.5X speed \n- Sweep to the down : normal speed \n\n• Additional features \n- Rotation Lock / Aspect ratio:auto/16:9/4:3/Full screen \n- Folder Management:Pass code/Move/Rename/Create \n- Resume play from last position \n- Scrubbing search \n- supports e-mail attachment by \"Open In\" feature \n\n• USB/WIFI Transfer \n\n• Note \n1. How to add video with USB \n- Run iTunes 9.1 or above \n- Device->My Device(My iPad)->Apps, drag and drop files to the AVplayer's documents \n\n2. Support High quality video clips ( 720P, 1080P )\n- High quality video clips of 720P (1280 x 720) or more are recommended for MP4 format. \n- MP4, MOV, M4V formats that QuickTime supports can be played up to 1080P by using H/W Decoder but, Post Processing function isn’t provided.\n- Support H/W decoding for MKV and AVI (720P supported on iPad1, 1080P supported on iPad2 / The New iPad)\n- Hybrid decoding mode is added and now it is able to play high resolution videos by using hardware accelerator feature embedded in iPhone/iPad even for mkv or avi in h264. Also battery use time has extended.\n- Application may crash in iPhone 3GS / iPod Touch due to heavy use of memory in Hybrid decoding. Try turning off all application running in background and reboot the device by holding down sleep mode button for long time.  \n- If screen shakes it means hardware decoding is not supported. Try turning off hybrid decoding.\n- When the file formats are available for MKV or AVI the player supports hardware decoding.\n- If you cannot choose audio in mp4 or avi, change the extension to mkv temporarily and chosen audio channel will be applied.\n\n3. The optimal speed when advancing its playing speed can differ depending on the way it’s compressed and the size. \nVideo clips of XVID (AVI) 720 x 480 can be fast played up to 1.3-1.5 times faster than normal.",

    "description": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nEven without a subscription, you'll always receive bug-fix and compatibility updates for free. These updates add support for the latest iPhones, iPads and Apple Watches. They also help ensure that Due continues to function well on the latest versions of iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you've purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4 then, that very same app in 2021 is now optimized for iPhone 12 Pro Max, iPad Pro running iOS 14, as well as on Apple Watch—and you don’t have to pay a single cent more to use the app on these devices, on the new iOS.\n\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later.",
