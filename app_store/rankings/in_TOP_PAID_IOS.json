Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "Chi Walking, the best-selling fitness walking book, is now an iPhone App to help you combine fitness, fun and fat-burning. Whether you’re returning from illness or injury, want to lose weight, or you’re walking in a fundraising event – this app will motivate and support you every step of the way!!\n\nUnique among walking apps, the Chi Walking® app is a complete coaching tool for improving your walking technique and boosting your training. \n\nWith video lessons that show you how to walk farther with less effort, and audio prompts that help you focus on good walking technique – you can improve everything about your walking experience. While learning to breathe better, strengthen your core, and improve your balance, you’ll see how walking is easier, more enjoyable, and more effective when you walk focused. \n\nInspired by the T’ai Chi principle of moving from your center, you’ll learn to rely more on your core and less on leg-strength to walk your best. You’ll practice “mindful movement” – using a smooth and relaxing technique to save your joints and muscles from overuse and injury.\n\nDanny’s voice will talk you through Guided Walks with audio focuses played at self-selected, repeating intervals. Track your distance, pace, caloric burn, and map your routes all within the app– you can even log notes on each walk to share with your friends! Use this app to start a regular walking program, walk your first 10K, or stay fit for the rest of your life. \n\nWalking never felt this good!",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

    "description": "The Panchang is ancient spiritual and scientific calendar system based on the positions of the planets, the sun and moon. One year is composed of 12 lunar months of around 29 days and 12 hours.\n\nFor every year, our panchang contains more than 340 important date of events and holy festivals in India. It reflects India's culture through the Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian and civil festivals happening all along the year. Nearly all the festivals are illustrated with a colorful image.\n\nThe calendar covers the full 2021 year. It also contains all the information from year 2009.\n\nIt contains all the details about the lunar cycles (Tithi and Karana), the planets (Nakshatra), the moon/sun combinaisons (Yoga), the full moons or purnima, the new moon or amavasaya, ... along with the Sunrise and Sunset timings.\n\nWhat's included:\n- Sun, Thithi and Nakshatra timings for several cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata) and around the World: Paris, London, Geneva, Moscow,New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, Los Angeles, Cape Town, Toronto, Melbourne, Sydney, Tokoy, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Hawaii, St Denis Réunion, Kuweit City, Colombo, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur. The timings are taking the daylight savings into account.\n Panchak for every month\n- At startup, the current month will be displayed, with an emphasis on the current day. Just clic on any day to get all the details about this particular day.\n- Lunar month days\n- Display the details on a day, including: western calendar information (gregorian calendar), Tithi information (moon day name, Shuklapaksh, Krishnapaksh, timings), Nakshatra (name and timings), Sun timings, list of festivals of that day\n- Display Vikram Samwat and Saka Samwat\n- A list of full moon (purnima) and new moon (amavasaya)\n- A list of events and holy festivals, sorted by months, with direct access to any month.\n- A list of government gazetted holidays\n- A very convenient search tool: Just type a word or the part of a word and get the list of all events related to your search.\n- An image for nearly every event\n- A list of major cities for which you want to see the detailed panchang. If your city is not in the list, you just select the closest one.\n\nWith the search tool, you can:\n- Write \"Prad\", you'll get the full list of Pradosh vrat of the year (worship of Lord Shiva, which is observed on the Trayodashi of both the fortnight - Shukla and Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Eka\", you'll get the full list of Ekadashi of the year (Ekadashi occurs on the 11th day of the bright half - called Shukla Paksha and on the 11th of the dark half called Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Chatur\", you'll get the full list of Ganesha and Vinayak Chaturthi of the year\n- Write \"Rohini\" or \"Ashtami\", and so on...\n\nOur calendar complied a Hindu Panchang according to Vedic science and modern outlook. We did a deep study to give you accurate information. We are still improving our panchang and updating the event's list.\n\nLiability Exclusion: We make every effort to ensure, but do not guarantee, the accuracy of the information on this calendar.

    "description": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 12 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nA part of the Pro Pack (*) add-on, this wonderful new feature allows you to split an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): Pro Pack® is a paid add-on, sold separately from inside the app, as an in-app purchase.",

Instead of spending all that time setting up your big camera, just choose your desired film/sensor size and focal length in the app and point the iPhone camera at what you want to photo to verify framing. If you are happy with the framing then you can get the big camera out. The app has a large database of camera sensors details and film formats but if the format you desire isn’t there you can add your own custom format. The app is targeted at stills photographers or film makers working in either film or digital. If you don’t have your big camera with you, Viewfinder Preview is still great for photo sketching, location scouting or story boarding.\n\nThe app includes\n\n- Customisable menus so you can include the film/sensor formats and focal lengths you care about.\n- A fully configurable light meter.\n- You can take photos with it, so you have a record of shots you were framing.\n- Photos taken with the app include additional data that describe the film format, focal length and lighting meter settings at the time the shot was taken\n- Add notes to your photos\n- A photo gallery for viewing photos taken with the app which also displays the additional data\n- Share images in emails, messages\n- Create albums of photos from the same project, trip etc\n- Create PDF documents of albums\n- Film stock emulation\n- Wide angle lens adapter support",

    "description": "Race an inch from the asphalt at speeds over 80 mph (125 kph) in Pro Racing Karts. 3 Tiers of Real Time Championships. No. 1 paid multiplayer racing game in 96 countries! (App Annie).  Download Now. \n\n\"You’ll never find another game like it. So competitive... It’s more than just a game.\" \nMarijn Kremers, FIA-CIK World and European Kart Champion (KZ)\n\n“I stopped real racing 3 as soon as I found this game.”\nMika Francis. App Store Review.\n\nSimilar karts, similar engines. Always close, fast, competitive.\n\nThis is Street Kart Racing.\n\nBRING IT ON...\nIf you need something new, original and ultra competitive, a real racing game, SK is it. \n\n\t⁃\tThe no.1 car racing game that will entertain you for more hours than you think! \n\t⁃\tExpect it to be challenging, fun, rewarding, the driving game you wanted. \n\t⁃\tNo Assists. No Excuses. Real racing 3 Tiers up to 80 mph.\n\t⁃\tTested for authenticity by hundreds of pro go kart / car racing drivers including world champions. Over 7 years in the making. \n\n----- YOUR GOAL -----\nKarting: racing to F1. Build your career in Cadet Karts\n\n\t⁃\tRace Real People, Real Tracks, Similar Kit. Real Racing.\n\t⁃\tBeat EVERYONE to become world go karting champion\n\t⁃\tSingle & multiplayer competition\n\n----- JOIN THE SK KARTING COMMUNITY -----\nSure we’re on the grid to win, and we race hard on the track. In the pits we all help each other out. \n\n\t⁃\tTips, tricks, advice. \n\t⁃\tA community of over 15,000. \n\t⁃\tCreate rivalries, join the banter, and always have someone to race.

So you’ll know when a rival speeds past you in a league or is beating your time on the asphalt 9 times out of 10!\n\nwww.facebook.com/groups/streetkartracing\n\n----- SMART GO KARTING STRATEGY ——\n- WEATHER: If it is raining at the go kart track in real life it is raining in the game. We simulate everything. Rain, drizzle, hot and cold temperatures affect tire choice and grip / drift. Air pressure affects the power delivered by the engine, speed and your lap time. More thought than your average driving game.\n- CHOICE: Like F1, a range of tire compounds from different brands are available as you advance.\n- RIVALRIES:  Win your own personal battles. Multiplayer racing will earn you sponsorship if you have the car racing skill and speed!\n-  UPGRADES: Make complex kart / driving game choices: exhaust, seats, brakes, fuel, engines, tyre pressures and setup: Making you fast, slow, grip, drift. \n\n-----  KEY FEATURES -----\nWe’re the no.1 go kart game. Here’s why:\n- On the grid: Real racing against real people.\n- Close: Race in closely matched go karts from real brands - none of this massive upgrade, automatic win! We race in tenths!\n- Compete against pro kart/ car racing drivers! Yes, they play Street Kart!\n- Real World tracks. Our grid: PFI, Adria, Wackersdorf, Mariembourg, Las Vegas Todd Road, and many more. No F1 tracks here.\n\nStreet Kart Racing works on all iPhone devices above the 6, iPad Mini 2, iPad Air or above. \n\n---- CAR RACING SIMULATOR ----\nNeed speed? Practice in solo mode with the 2018 World Champions Rosberg Racing Academy. Improve your set ups and racing skills with real racing lines in our solo racing simulator. This is a proper driving game.\n\n----- Follow Us -----\nwww.streetkart.me\nwww.instagram.com/streetkart\nwww.youtube.com/streetkart\n\nDevelopment Team\nStreet Kart Racing has ambassadors who race at the highest level of professional go kart racing / car racing - helping perfect the racing game simulator physics. You'll find them on the asphalt at tracks worldwide aiming to reach F1.  This is the Most Competitive Driving Game For Mobile.\n\nAbout Us\nWe’re a small indie team but we don't believe that should mean average.

If you experience glitching of audio or dropped video frames, the problem is very likely a wifi connection which is insufficiently stable to support smooth NDI video to iOS - in this case please try a wired ethernet to lightning adaptor.\n\nYou should not expect perfect performance when selecting Hi Resolution NDI - which is offered as an experimental mode for users with very fast devices, on very fast, clean network connections.  In some cases you may see great results in hi res.\n\nThere are preferences in the System Settings app for NDI Monitor to setup application options. You can also use the app NDI Scanner as a stream selector -  it will open NDI Monitor when you click on a selected stream.\n \nNB. This app does not support NDI | HX format streams - only full NDI format.",

As a reward, they will love helping Splingo build a space ship and complete the tasks in order to get him home. His hilarious animated responses will capture your child’s imagination. \n\nSplingo’s instructions range from a very early level of language development, e.g. single word recognition, to much more complex, e.g. instructions combining several aspects of language at once. \n\nA guide to the levels:\n•Level 1 -contains instructions of 1 main word and is suitable for children at a developmental level of about 18 months onwards, e.g. “find the apple”\n•Level 2 - contains instructions of 2 main words and is suitable for children at a developmental level of about 2-3 years, e.g. “find the red apple”\n•Level 3 - contains instructions of 3 main words and is suitable for children at a developmental level of about 3- 4 years and upwards, e.g. “find the big red apple”\n•Level 4 - contains instructions of 4 main words and is suitable for children at a developmental level of about 4 years and upwards, e.g. “give the big red apple to the boy”\n\nWhile your child is experiencing an entertaining, motivating game, you can be reassured that they are learning a variety of different aspects of language, including naming words (nouns), action words (verbs), location words (prepositions), description words (adjectives), e.g. color, size and much more!  \n\nThe game is completely customisable so you can create a combination of levels and word types to suit your child’s developmental level.\n\nAn SLP:\n\"The children all love Splingo...especially the encouraging words (yep,yep,yep, ooh whoo etc!) and the rocket!

You can even select a US or UK voice and decide whether you’d like the written sentence to be displayed alongside the verbal instruction.\n\nComprehension:\n\nYour child will follow Splingo’s instructions to develop comprehension of pronouns, with feedback provided by Splingo to ensure they are learning each time.  \n\nExpression:\n\nWe’ve included a pause button to give the child time to describe what is happening on the screen to help them practise the expressive use of pronouns.  Thanks to those of you who have been kind enough to get in touch to suggest this.\n\nQuality images and animations:\n\nSplingo will take your child on an adventure through five different scenes; a café, park, zoo, school and a shop, which will come alive with cool images and amusing animations!\n\nMotivating and fun:\n\nYour child can explore their creative side with the exciting reward game; for each scene completed they can select three different prizes to style their own bedroom. They can even paint the walls to their liking and dance along to the crazy sound effects!\n\nKeep in touch:\n\nWe’re fortunate to be part of an inspiring online community of parents, SLPs, teachers, app reviewers and others who share our love of exciting, useful therapy resources.

    "description": "Fact Fluency: Mastering Multiplication is a unique math app for kids in 1st through 4th grade. Through animated tutorials, meaningful visuals and engaging, interactive games, kids will master the multiplication facts, one set at a time. They will learn how multiplication relates to addition, the real world and other multiplication facts.\n\nKids begin by working through learning paths for the multiplication facts in an order that makes sense: x2, x10/x5, x4, x3, x6, x9, x7 and then x8.\n\nIn the x2 set, they begin by seeing multiplication as equal groups. They then practice skip counting and repeated addition to see how skills they already know relate to multiplication. They then move on to x10 and x5, since these are typically the easier facts for kids to master. This module helps them to build confidence as they learn multiplication. This module uses place value, dimes and nickels to help kids build on math that is already familiar and build a strong foundation. They will also see how the x5 facts relate to the x10 facts, again, building fact fluency.\n\nSubsequent modules weave in additional skills related to multiplication, while still only focusing on one set of facts at a time. As kids progress through each path, they will learn the commutative property of multiplication, learn how to break apart area models to solve problems, use number lines and hundred chart to solve and use number bonds to visualize fact families and see how multiplication relates to division. \n\nThroughout the modules, kids will also practice finding the missing factor, further strengthening their understanding of multiplication, adding an additional challenge and paving the way to learn and master the multiplication facts.  \n\nAfter successfully completing all 8 multiplication fact modules, they can use the 1- and 2-player review games to review a mixture of all facts. These simple games provide the repetition and practice kids need to solidify the facts using engaging games rather than flash cards or rote memorization.\n\nBy using powerful visuals and meaningful strategies to learn the facts and build comprehension, your kids will be on their way to fact fluency and mastering the multiplication facts from 2-10!\n\nMultiplication strategies\n\n2nd grade math\n\n3rd grade math\n\n4th grade math\n\n5th grade math\n\nMultiplication fact families",
