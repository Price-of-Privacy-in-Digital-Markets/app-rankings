    "description": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!",

An instrument that is both pitch fluid, and helps the performer precisely reach desired musical pitches in any temperament.  \n\nGeoShred is an award-winning,  fluidly expressive musical instrument that runs on multi-touch devices. \n\nIt has a performance surface with “almost magic” pitch rounding algorithms which is coupled with a model of the physics of several types of musical instruments, support for AUv3, MIDI In/Out, MPE, and 3D Touch.  It’s a fusion of Jordan Rudess’ performance concepts and a powerful, modeled guitar/effects based on the Physical Modeling research of Dr. Julius O. Smith III of Stanford/CCRMA.  And, GeoShred's expressive control can be used with other synthesizers.\n\nTens of thousands of artists in 48 countries perform GeoShred with 30% of those users in India. \n\nGeoShred is the Gold Medal Winner of the 2019 Denny Award, winner of a 2019 Guthman New Musical Instrument Award, and winner of the 2017 Electronic Musician Editor's Choice Award as \"one of the most innovative, groundbreaking products to emerge in the past twelve months\".\n\n\nGeoShred Pro Version 5 Features include:\n\n• In-App-Purchases (IAP) for 6 different GeoSWAM instruments, GeoViolin, GeoFlute, GeoTenoSax, GeoCello, GeoClarinet, and GeoOboe \n• A fluidly expressive playing surface + a Physically modeled guitar\n• Au3 plugin support on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater \n• Intelligent pitch rounding\n• A diatonic keyboard where every key on the screen is in the scale.\n• MIDI IN/OUT and MPE support\n• MIDI control using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, virtual MIDI and all digital interfaces \n• MIDI configuration presets\n• 3D touch on iPhones that support 3D touch\n• Customizable control surface can be mapped to physical MIDI controls\n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus support.\n• Backing tracks\n• Multiple Modeled effects\n• Modeled feedback and VCF effects\n• Echo, a unique looper and multi-tap echo \n• Finger vibrato, slide and fret scraping\n• Unique mono mode using intervals of multiple strings. \n• Built-in Arpeggiator\n• Alternative tunings and temperaments\n• Support for world scales and temperaments including Indian Ragas, Arabic and Balinese scales. \n• Easily share presets with friends\n\n---\n \nPraise for the GeoShred family of apps: \n\n“GeoShred is brilliant- it’s a real instrument.” – Eddie Jobson\n\n“A fantastic new invention which is going to revolutionize the way music is played, expressed and learned! “GeoShred” is one of the foremost best musical inventions I’ve had the pleasure to experience in recent years. Definitely 5 stars out of 5! GIGANTASTIVISSIMO…..R…A…Z !!!!!” – Patrick Moraz\n\n“That’s just nuts. You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.  It would mean a lot to us if you could leave your positive review on the App Store and If you have any questions about GeoShred we would love to hear from you at our support email address: support@moforte.com \n\n---\n\nMinimum Requirements:  iOS 11.4 or better is required for AUv3, iCloud and GeoSWAM instruments.\n***Note: The GeoSWAM instruments can ONLY be performed from the GeoShred keyboard or MPE controllers.\n***Note: Unfortunately, due to App Store limitations, previously purchased instrument IAPs can not be applied to a purchase of the collection IAP.",

Leaves are the most commonly observed part for detecting an infection.\nTake note that symptoms in some plants can appear slowly, so usually it is difficult for farmers to notice and correctly diagnose the plant disease.\n\n+ This app could diagnose the disease of the following diseases:\nApple scab, Cedar apple rust, Black rot, Powdery mildew, Cercospora leaf spot, Gray leaf spot, Common rust, Northern leaf blight, Eriophyes vitis, Grape esca (Black Measles), Leaf blight (Isariopsis leaf spot), Orange haunglongbing (Citrus greening), Leaf scorch, Early blight, Leaf Mold,\nSeptoria leaf spot, Two-spotted spider mite, Tomato target spot, Mosaic virus, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, Bacterial spot and Late blight.\n\n+ So you can take a picture of the following plant leaves to detect them:\nTomatoes, Pepper, Apple, Pear, Quince, Grape  vines, Cabbage, Broccoli, Potato, Lemon, Orange, Sweet potato, Cauliflower, Raspberry, Squash, Corn, Peach, Strawberry, Roses, Apricot, Nectarine and Plum.\n\nThe rapid, accurate diagnosis of disease severity will help to reduce yield losses.\n\nAnother Advantages:\n+ You can have more reliable source of food\n+ You can grow more crops. \n+ You can protect them.\n\nThis app allows the opportunity to use computer vision techniques to monitor the disease type and severity and increase yields. \nA huge image database (thousand of images) has been used to get the maximum accuracy using artificial neural networks .\n\nThis app has also an option to report an image that couldn’t be recognised. If that is the case, it is automated that you can report it immediately by email to the author. So it guarantees that the database image will be improved constantly.\n\nThe intended purpose of this app is help the farmers to build a better and bigger crops, which results in a more sustainable world.\n\nDiseases are a major thread to losses of modern agricultural production.

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",

    "description": "The 'YO YO Endurance Test' provides an important instrument for determining the level of physical efficiency of an athlete.\nThe physical capacity is evaluated quickly and easily by placing two cones spaced 20 meters each other.\nThe athlete has to run at full speed from one cone to another and then return again on the first cone. This path must be repeated for six times without any break, and get  the split times every time the athlete passes on the first cone.\n\nThis application will track all the split time and at the end will be calculated two parameters that determine the outcome of the test. More these values are low and better will be the athlete's performance.\n\nBasically the final result is given by a mathematical formula that processes the delta between the averages of the last two split times and the first two split times  and thereby the athlete's ability to maintain its maximum speed for a certain period of time.\n\nThe second value obtained on completion of the test, is the first result considering also the total time of the test.\n\nThe 'YO YO Endurance Test' can be used to determine the level of athletic in all sports (football, running, basketball, volleyball, cycling, tennis etc.)\nAt the end of the test you can get for each athlete the final result (eg. \"Above average\" or \"Poor\") and the Vo2Max estimate\n\nYou can manage more Athletes and save personal data and notes.\nYou can analyze test results.\nAutomatic Sync between devices thanks to iCloud\nInfo section where you can better understand how prepare the test and you can visit linked website and video where get more info about YO-YO Endurance Test\n\nIf you find this application useful, please give a positive review in the AppStore, so we can further improve and develop new options.\n\nFor any further information, please send an email to:\nsupport@bitandweb.com\n\nThanks",

    "description": "Why do we chant the Yoga Sutra of Maharishi Patanjali? When we write things out and work with the written word, we are dealing with external forms. The written form is the grossest level of interpretation of oral traditions. When we chant we use our vocal apparatus to produce the sound. The process brings us into the eternal NOW. When we write, a long lapse of time can pass between the time of writing and our re-reading. When we chant, the action brings us in the present moment. The process of chanting demands full attention, at least on the physical level. There is also the question of resonance. Chanting evokes and invokes resonance in letters and words. All mantra can be chanted in three forms, the vachika form(chanting externally, uttering sound) is the between, and the likita (writing) is the grossest. The subtlest way to approach the sutra would be to chant them at the level of the mind. Yet, this requires full knowledge of what one is doing. It follows that when we chant we are in the NOW, we are vibrating, and we know what we are uttering so that when we move to the subtlest plane and we chant without uttering sound, in our mind, we are as close as possible to the most perfect sound.\n\nChanting led by:\nYogacharya Dr. Ananda Balayogi Bhavanani",

    "description": "> Find the ElectroMagnetic Fields around you in seconds.\n> Organize your life away from the EMF risk zones.\n\nCheck out the areas where you work (desk, meeting rooms), where you sleep (bed), where you relax (couch, living room) and find the levels of EMF you are exposed to. \nAlso use the app to measure the fields emitted by your appliances (computer, fridge, speaker, phone...)\n\nNo need to buy expensive equipment. \nThe EMF Detector app on your phone will help you detect the EMF risk zones.\nFeel free to re-organize your home in order to limit lengthy exposure to high EMF zones.\n\nSo download now and improve your well-being!\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\n=> What are Electro-Magnetic Fields?\nElectro-Magnetic Fields are everywhere around us, in everything that is electric or electronic. Think about computers, phones, power lines, cellular towers, lights, Wi-Fi, Smart TVs… All these items emit low-frequency radiations around them. \nThese Electro Magnetic Radiations can interfere with other electronic items. That is why you can sometimes see glitches on a TV or distortion in sound or music. \nOur world will continue to showcase incremental interconnection with appliances that emit EMF. These tools have provided an enormous range of benefits for humans. But it is necessary to keep in mind all impacts on well being.\n\n=> Why should I care?\nNumerous studies have shown impacts on biological creatures. There are still discussions around the seriousness of the harm it could cause to human beings though. Our bodies are a complex network of cells, brains, and matter that are sensitive to the outside world in ways we do not fully understand yet. \nResearch seems to indicate impacts on well being, disturbing sleep cycles and affecting our immune system. Globally it could contribute to numerous health problems. As a result, cautionary behavior is recommended for all and especially for people looking to improve their well being.\n\n=> What can I do?\nUse this application to detect EMF exposure around you. Walk around your house with the app and spot the locations with high radiations. \nMake sure to limit the time spent next to these zones, especially during extended periods like during sleep. \nSo place your couch, your bed and your sofa away from these spots. Check the emission levels around places where you spent a lot of time: your kitchen, living room, bedroom. Check your laptop, TV, alarm clock, cell phones, Wi-Fi, air conditioner…\nBut also measure exposure outside your home: where you work, where you practice sport. Also, limit exposure to cell towers that emit a high level of EMF.\n\nNote: \n- This app will not work on an iPod Touch since it does not have a compass hardware.\n- This app does not guarantee completely exact measures as other fields can interfere with the compass inside your phone, which is used to detect the fields.",

The app measures with high accuracy the breakpoint angle achieved on the NHE, based on recent research that shows that this angle is highly related to hamstring eccentric strength. Moreover, based on that angle and using some cool biomechanics, it also measures an important metric, the torque (rotational force) at that point! \n\nFor this, and taking into account the well-known benefits of the NHE for the prevention of hamstring injuries, Nordics can help you monitor your athletes to improve your prevention protocols and get the most out of your athletes!\n\nNordics is very simple to use but includes advanced features that can help you monitor the performance of your athletes in the NHE in a professional way such as:\n\n-Measures the torque and breakpoint angle on the NHE using accurate video-analysis\n-Measures your leg asymmetry with the unilateral test\n-Organize your athletes in teams, and create as many teams and athletes as you want. Unlimited data base!\n-Export your whole database to a CSV file to work in Excel or other spreadsheet apps\n-Save as many tests as you want for each athlete and check his/her evolution over the season\n-Get warnings when your athlete significantly decreases his/her performance so you can readjust your training program\n\nNordics, measure your NHE performance and prevent hamstrings injuries with your iPhone, iPad or Mac!",

We've tried all the apps that let you do it over WiFi, but they're not fast enough, so we also allow you to use a wired USB connection.\n\nQUALITY VIDEO\nYour iPhone/iPad camera's are good, really good. In fact, there’s no comparison between the highly recommended streaming webcam, the Logitech C922 HD Pro and the iPhone 6 Camera. Stream Landscape or Portrait video.\n\nAUDIO\nIf you don't have a separate mic for your streaming setup, you can now use the microphone on your iOS device to stream audio & video.\n\nFRONT CAMERA\nStream a selfie with the front camera support. Switch anytime during the stream with the familiar camera switch button.\n\nTAP TO FOCUS, PINCH TO ZOOM\nControls just like you're used to from the Camera app.\n\nMANUAL CONTROLS\nTake control of the focus, exposure, white balance as you would on a manual DSLR camera.\n\nLOW LATENCY\nStream video over a wired USB connection. This avoids the issue of delay over wifi, as many other solutions suffer from. This is just as fast as a USB webcam!\n\nUSB & WIFI\nChoose the connection type. If you want low latency, use USB, if you'd like portability then use WiFi. WiFi is done using the NewTek™ NDI® protocol, so you can use Camera for OBS Studio with any NewTek™ NDI® compatible receiver.\n\nMULTIPLE DEVICES\nIf you're lucky enough to own multiple iOS devices, use them together and produce a multi-camera stream.\n\nMAC AND PC\nSupports OBS Studio running on macOS and Windows.\n\nYou will need to install the OBS Studio iOS Camera Plugin from our website, or use an NDI compatible receiver to use this app.\n\nFor the best possible experience make sure your device is listed on our website https://obs.camera/docs/faqs/#what-ios-hardware-do-i-need",

    "description": "Are you ready to accept the gift of madness and understand the secrets of the deep? If yes — “Mental Hospital IV” is waiting for you.\n\nYour intellect is thirsty for non standard tasks, and nervous for a “tickle”? Than horror-action “Mental Hospital IV” from AGaming+ will shake you to the core! Cut the lights, connect your headphones. And watch out, because he is the only one to help you to get out of these horror paws!\n\nOur history started a short time afterwards, after the events at Mental Hospital III. The principal character’s mind was haunted with a story that happened in the St. Peter Hospital. Police sat back on its heels, big newspapers kept quiet. And then, one fine day, a stranger called us and said that he could tell everything in details in a face-to-face meeting. And you are going to a specified place... What can be simpler?!.. That is what you thought also. But you will remember till the end of our life about the story, you got involved to. After you had crushed into an orphan home you got to close quarters with its inmates. And realized that what you saw there cannot be described in words, it may be erased from a cassette, but never from your memory.\n\nAnd it rests with you only, whether you will be able to solve this tangle of chaos and horror.",

    "description": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

    "description": "TV Mirror+ for Chromecast is the easy screen sharing tool to mirror your iPhone or iPad screen and sound on Chromecast in Full HD Quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Chromecast.\n\n* Supported Chromecasts: Chromecast, Chromecast Ultra and all generations of the Chromecast family\n\n* Supported TVs and other devices: Xiaomi MI Box, NVIDIA Shield TV and all TVs with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, e.g. Sony, TCL, Vizio, Sharp, Philips, Hisense, Skyworth, Soniq\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Chromecast must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here.",

Ishraq prayer is 10 to 12 minutes after sunrise. There is a misconception where Islamic websites and people use the word \"Ishraq\" and then give timings for actual Sunrise. Praying at sunrise is forbidden and must be performed after at least 10 minutes of sunrise. iPray for this reason adds 10 minutes to sunrise and labels it correctly as \"Ishraaq\".\n\n* Prayer Alerts will ONLY alert you with an initial Takbir. The full azan (and its length) is NOT supported by the iOS alert mechanism as there is a maximum limit of 30 seconds of audio playback.",

Finally, an app which allows hours of solid tabla riaz with authentic Sarangi, and Santoor lehra accompaniment. \n\nIntroducing the world's first real lehra mobile application for tabla players. Lehra Studio provides live lehra accompaniment for tabla riaz and solo classical performances. \n\nAn experienced team of developers, tabla players and world renowned musicians have combined forces to create a revolution in Indian lehra technology.

With Lehra Studio, every tabla player can now experience a real live-simulated environment during their riaz sessions.\n\nLehra Studio's first rollout boasts an extensive file library which includes real Sarangi and Santoor lehra, recorded in over 15 different varieties of raga.

RTA is a professional-grade acoustical analysis tool. All filters meet or exceed ANSI and IEC Class 1 specifications. \n\nIncludes Octave and 1/3 Octave modes, with selectable decay times, as well as Peak Hold and true linear Average mode.\n\n*** iOS Microphones\n\nWe have analyzied every iOS device, including all of the iPads, all iPhones, and iPod touches, and have created microphone compensation files that are applied automatically. You can trust the results you are getting, often within just a few dB of a far more expensive analyzer. Calibration is updated regularly, automatically, from our cloud-based calibration database.\n\nUpgrade to our iTestMic or iAudioInterface2 to bring your system up to full professional specs.\n\n*** Save and Recall Graphs\n\nYou can save and recall graphs, marked with the GPS location, date & time, and your comment, as well as store the image to your photo roll.\n\nExport the data as an XLS formatted file to your computer for inclusion in reports or further analysis.\n\n*** Max and Min Bars\n\nYou can also turn on resettable Max/Min bars (see image #4) to capture peaks. Double-tap to reset the bars.\n\n*** Specifications and Devices\n\nThe internal iPhone mic has a noise floor near 30 dB, and if your are running iOS 6, clips around 120 dB. \n\n*** Touch GUI\n\nFully interactive touch GUI features includes scroll up/down, pinch to zoom or compress the vertical dB scale, or swipe horizontally to get a cursor that reads out the exact dB level and frequency across the screen. To make the cursor disappear, swipe it off the graph to the left.\n\nThe landscape-mode display flips 180 degrees so that you can face the internal mic in either direction.\n\n*** Overlay Curves\n\nAlso included are optional noise curve overlays, in NCB, RC, PNC, NC, X-Curve and NR mode. See picture #2 for an example. Use this feature to get a quick reading on the noise levels in a room. Also includes the cinema large-room X-curve overlay.\n\n*** Calibration\n\nRTA can be fully calibrated, whether you are using it with the internal iOS microphone, or one of our professional test & measurement mic solutions. And, if you are using iTestMic, the mic calibration is transmitted directly to the app, so you are always calibrated.\n\n*** RTA or FFT?\n\nIf you are wondering if you should download this app or our FFT app, check out our website, we have a page devoted to this topic.\n\nSee our other acoustics and audio apps, including AudioTools.",

No computer testing here!\n\nIndeed our more advanced puzzles have been carefully designed to showcase some of the diabolical techniques in an intuitive way with the aim of helping solvers UNDERSTAND the patterns involved.\n\nIn Cracking The Cryptic’s games, players start with zero stars and earn stars by solving puzzles. The more puzzles you solve, the more stars you earn and the more puzzles you get to play. Only the most dedicated (and cleverest) sudoku players will finish all the puzzles!\n\nFeatured authors include (obviously) Simon and Mark but also some other authors who have produced popular puzzles on the channel!\n\nMark and Simon have both represented the UK many times in the World Sudoku Championship and you can find more of their puzzles (and lots of others) on the internet’s biggest sudoku channel, Cracking The Cryptic.\n\nFeatures:\n100 beautiful puzzles\nMany themes to choose from\nHints written by Mark and Simon!",
