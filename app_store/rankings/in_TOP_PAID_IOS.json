    "description": "DoubleTake by FiLMiC transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nDoubleTake gives you an early look at the multi-cam capability that will be coming to our award-winning cinema camera app FiLMiC Pro.  \n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll.",

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with exactly the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest matt black presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its full-screen appearance integrates with the iPhone/iPad device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Option to show seconds when tapping screen\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock.",

It is also the most configurable workout app, with over 300 live metrics, graphs and buttons that can be displayed in many different screen layouts.  It's perfect for running, cycling, hiking, skiing, geocaching and much more.\n\nNote: The app requires an Apple Watch.\n\nThe map is drawn using vectors, which means that it can be smoothly zoomed, panned or rotated, just like maps on the iPhone.  The data comes from OpenStreetMap, which includes paths, tracks, cycle trails and much more.\n\nMaps can be stored on the Watch for use when you don't have your iPhone or cannot get a data signal.  And the price includes maps for the whole world.  No further purchases or subscriptions are required!\n\nInterval Schedules can be created to assist your workout.  For example warm up for 5 minutes, run fast for a mile and recover for a minute 5 times, and then cool down for 5 minutes.\n\nThe iPhone app provides detailed analysis of workouts; exporting of workouts; configuration of watch screen layouts; importing of GPX routes; and the ability to control the map areas that are stored offline on your Watch.\n\nWorkouts performed using the WorkOutDoors watch app can also be inspected on the iPhone by using Apple's Health and Activity apps.\n\nWorkOutDoors includes many useful map and workout-related features:\n\nMAP FEATURES:\n\n- automatic map rotation according to direction of motion or the compass;\n- a breadcrumb trail of your route;\n- the map can be panned with your finger, and zoomed with the digital crown;\n- a circular scale appears when zooming in or out;\n- \"map-only mode\" shows the map without starting a workout;\n- GPX routes can be imported and displayed on the map;\n- routes are coloured in varying shades of purple: red for uphill; blue for downhill;\n- POIs and route waypoints can be tapped for more details;\n- double tap for a full screen map;\n\nWORKOUT FEATURES:\n\n- many different screen layouts and text sizes;\n- configure multiple data screens and cycle through them by swiping the display;\n- configure what metrics are shown on each screen from a pool of over 300 live metrics;\n- configure interval schedules (e.g. warm-up, run fast then rest x 10, cool down)\n- manual or configurable automatic laps (e.g. every mile or km);\n- summary information, including lap splits, can be shown at any time during the workout;\n- splits available for pace, distance, time, heart rate, calories, elevation and steps;\n- interval alerts for distances (e.g. every mile), times, steps, calories, ascent and descent;\n- limit alerts for heart rates, pace, speed and cadence;\n- configurable heart rate zones with dozens of zone-related metrics and graphs;\n- configurable target pace/speed with fields such as distance vs target and time vs target;\n- target can be shown as a live icon on the map to show how far ahead or behind you are;\n- 3 individually configurable rolling pace fields (e.g last mile, last minute etc);\n- 28 different activity types;\n- multiple types of graphical data fields: historical graphs, bar charts, trail maps and more;\n- button fields provide shortcuts for any operation or to quickly show any settings screen;\n- \"Now Playing\" music controls now available from a button within the app;\n- workouts can be directly uploaded to Strava or exported as GPX files for use in other apps and websites; \n\nOTHER FEATURES:\n\n- works even without an iPhone on watches with GPS;\n- compass pointing north (which also acts as a button to control rotation);\n- \"start compass\" pointing to your start location (tap it for distance to start);\n- GPS signal strength indicator (tap it to see accuracy in metres);\n- Battery level indicator;\n- Geocache GPX files can be loaded (tap a cache for full groundspeak data);\n\nIf you own an Apple Watch and enjoy running, cycling, hiking, skiing, or any other outdoor exercise, then WorkOutDoors is the app for you.

    "description": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it is – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows. And your settings are automatically synced to all your devices using iCloud.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy",
