It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.\n\nFor Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR.

We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you.

This is big as now you can capture action with burst but at the uncompressed quality pros want with RAW.\n+ HEIF and HEVC - Seamless support for the latest Apple file formats across photos and videos.\n\n## Filmmaker Features\n+ Focus peaking - the yellow edge glow will help you find dial in the focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ Color Profiles - Select from default, flat, or log color profiles to get the most out of your files in post-processing.\n+ Video Bitrates - Get precise control over video quality with standard, medium, and high bitrates to choose from.\n+ RGB Histogram: Dial in your video color, balance, and exposure with a live RGB histogram.\n+ Waveform monitor - Evaluate video brightness and exposure across your image in real time.\n+ Audio meters - Get just the right sound levels with real-time, precise, dual-channel (when available) audio levels.\n+ Live Histogram - Get your exposure right every time.\n+ Video Stabilization - Make your videos buttery smooth.\n+ Precise Video - Change your resolution and frame rate on screen, without digging into a settings menu.\n+ Anamorphic - Use the Moment Anamorphic lens to shoot amazing, letterbox style photos and videos.\n\n## Works With\n+ Triple/Dual Lens Control - Manually control which side of the triple/dual lens you want to shoot with so you can use Moment lenses over either one.\n+ Moment Lens - select which lens you are shooting with.\n+ Moment Battery Case - Works with the DSLR-like shutter button on our photography cases for half-press and full-press capture. Take better photos, faster.\n+ Apple Watch - Use your watch as a remote to shoot photos or record videos.\n+ Siri Shortcuts - Quick access to capture a photo or start a video\n\nRAW and 3D shutter require an iPhone 6S or later (6S, 7, 8, X, XS, XR, SE)",

You can edit the slides order by going into the Edit mode (top left button)\n- to add background music to the Slideshow, from the side menu, tap the Pick Song button and load a song from your device's library.

    "description": "\"Unruly Heroes” is a 2D action-adventure mobile game developed by the indie team at Magic Design Studios and published by Perfect World. The story is inspired by China’s first mythological novel \"Journey to the West” and strives to bring players an innovative experience through a fantastical art style and hilarious plot.\nSince the dawn of time, Buddhist scripture held the balance between Heaven, Earth, and the myriad creatures. However, as Evil’s wickedness began to grow, this delicate balance was thrown into chaos when the divine scripture was torn to pieces and scattered across the land. Those creatures that have encountered the mythical power of the fragments inherited unprecedented power. In doing so, this newfound strength kindled their heart’s innermost wickedness, turning them into horrifying monsters. With a world in chaos, a master and his three disciples accept Guan Yin’s decree and set out to reunite the fragments into a new scripture.\nThe game follows the journey of a master and his three disciples as they fight, solve puzzles, collect loot, parkour, platform and more on their mystical demon-slaying adventure. You must capitalize on their special attacks and holy relics in a battle of wit and bravery against demons to complete their pilgrimage in reuniting the scripture.\nFollowing its release on Steam and consoles, the mobile edition of “Unruly Heroes” is now available!\nHighlights:\nFantastic hand-drawn art style—Rich and in-depth level design illustrates a vivid sense of realism.\nSwitch between the master and disciples—Effortlessly switch between the four characters both in and out of combat to overcome puzzles and obstacles.\nRich and varied gameplay—Over ten different gameplay elements including: fighting, puzzle solving, loot collecting, parkour, platforming and more.\n\nAwards\n“Unruly Heroes” won the 47th Annie Award for best game character animation.\n\nFacebook: @UnrulyHeroesGame\nDeveloper Info: Magic Design Studios\nOfficial website: www.magicdesignstudios.com",

Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength. All this data appears on the dash and can be managed with the mode switch, keeping your hands where they belong: on the handlebar.",

Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you.",

Quickly find rhymes, near rhymes, synonyms, antonyms,  homophones, similar sounding words, words with the same consonant pattern, and other related words (generalizations, specializations, words appearing in the same context).\n\nYou get a database of way over 100,000 words and phrases right at your fingertips. Find rhymes without an internet connection, but if you are on the net when you use the app, it can connect you to RhymeZone.com for definitions and all the other great features you've come to love. Or you can look it up using your phone's dictionaries, or on our sister site, OneLook.com. You can even hear it pronounced with your device's built-in text-to-speech.\n\nThere's also a nifty \"Poet Maker\" feature, which lets you find words that match constraints on both rhyme and meaning at the same time. For example, suppose you want a word that rhymes with \"cat\" and means \"heavy\"; this feature will answer \"fat\" in no time. Or suppose you're looking for a rhyme of \"curious\" that means \"invalid\"; you'll get \"spurious\". You get the idea! This feature is experimental; registered users of the app will get free upgrades as they become available.\n\nSo whether you're looking to put on the finishing touches of a love poem, bust out the next rap lyric, or just seeking some clever wordplay for your English assignment, give the app a try!",

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",
