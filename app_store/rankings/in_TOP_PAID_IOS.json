Continue reading to learn more about this unique app!\n\n-----------------------\n\n• Featured numerous times by Apple:\n\n- App Store Essentials: Camera & Photography\n- Photography for Professionals - Total Control\n- Shot on iPhone 6 - Shoot Beautiful Photos\n- Extraordinary Photo Apps\n- Best New App\n\n• Nominated for the 2010 and 2011 \"Best App Ever Award - Best Photo App\"\n\n-----------------------\n\n\"It’s one of those rare photography apps that creates effects that few others are capable of, and it does it easily and with better results.\"\n— Marty Yawnick, Life In LoFi\n\n-----------------------\n\nHow many times have you tried to capture artful images with your iPhone camera but were left wishing you had more features to work with? Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.\n \nSlow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:\n \nMOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.\n\nLIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Sony Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Sony TV.\n\nThis works on any Sony Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. \n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Sony TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Sony TV app. It will start looking for your Sony TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Sony TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Sony TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat. Also their support is brilliant, they responded in less than an hour of the query I emailed to them.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nShould you choose not to subscribe, after one year, you will continue to receive updates in the form of bug fixes and compatibility updates with the latest devices, iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4 then, that very same app in 2020 is now optimized for iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad Pro running iOS 13, as well as on Apple Watch—and you don’t have to pay a single cent more to use the app on these devices, on the new iOS.\n\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later.",

    "description": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any LG Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your LG TV.\n\nThis works on any LG Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. \n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your LG TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for LG TV app. It will start looking for your LG TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model LG TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for LG TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Mirroring made Easy\" - 5 STARS - by JBGuam\nAbsolutely great app, worked seamlessly with my tv, lag was minimal, but to be fair only receiving 40-45 mbs instead of 100+ mbs in the particular room I tried this. Should be even better with faster internet speeds.\n\n\"Works Great!!\" - 5 STARS - by czerkman\nNot sure why others had problems, I followed the directions and it worked perfectly. Ingenious idea from a developers standpoint.\n\n\"The app works great\" - 5 STARS - by Alivesbg\nNo problems... Good set by step set-up.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "This app was developed independently of the MIT Scratch Team, which produces the Scratch programming language and online community. The Scratch name and Scratch cat are trademarks of MIT.\n\n\"Scratch 2 games\" brings you a whole bunch of video tutorials to get you going making your own games in the new web based version of scratch. This are not the sort of standard tutorials that you find on the web. During the videos you will be set tasks to do in scratch and hopefully you will be able to complete them on your own. However don't worry the next video in each project will show you how to complete the task!!\n\nSo what will you learn to build in this new version of Scratch? Well there are 3 games to be covered here. A leap back to retro games with \"Frogger\" and \"Breakout\", then there is also a guide to how to create your own 2 player \"top down racer\" game.\n\nThere's even a quiz in the app so you can test your scratch knowledge too!!\n\nScratch really is a fantastic way into learning programming and coding and this app hopefully will be a great asset to get you going with it.\n\nThis is a big app of just under 300Mb, because there is so much material in it. You will need to be hooked into your WiFi connection!!  Also suggest that you set up an account with Scratch before stepping into the screencasts.\n\n*TEACHERS* the point of this app is that kids can use the iPad alongside the pc to build their games in Scratch. You can just sit back and relax without having to plan anything. Oh and there is enough material to keep your students busy for around 6 hours, even if they don't manage to have a go at the extension tasks that are identified for all 3 games!!\n\nIF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING NO SOUND ON YOUR IPAD IT IS BECAUSE YOU NEED TO FLICK THE MUTE SWITCH NEXT TO YOUR VOLUME CONTROL.",

    "description": "Sit on the throne as a benevolent (or malevolent) medieval monarch of the modern age and swipe your royal fingers either left or right to impose your will upon the kingdom. Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.\n\n*iPhone 5 / iPod Touch 6 / iPad Mini / iPad Air or later recommended.",

    "description": "Color Screen is a beautiful iOS app that provides an excellent solution for displaying a color of choice on the iPhone/iPad screen at a brightness desired. It provides a wide range of colors to choose from. It can be used in any situation that requires a colored light with adjustable brightness.\n\nYou can also see the hex values and RGB values of the colors to transfer them easily to other editing softwares. The app also remembers last used color, so whenever you come back, it'll start right as you left it.\n\nPossible uses - \n\n- Use for lighting macro photography scenes with literally as bright a colored screen as your iPhone/iPad would allow.\n- Use as red light for star gazing. \n- Use strobe function with a bright color to help others (friends, family, cabs etc.) locate you easily at crowded locations (movie theatres, clubs, parties, street side etc.)\n- Use for design purposes to get HEX and RGB values of desired colors.\n- Send color codes to others via text or copy to clipboard to paste to other apps.\n- If you received HEX code or RGB code for a color from somebody, easily enter it in the app to see what the color looks like.\n\nFeatures - \n\n- Choose any color using hue, saturation and brightness sliders.\n- See the HEX and RGB codes of the selected color.\n- Update the HEX value directly to get a desired color on screen.\n- Update RGB value directly to get a desired color on screen. \n- No ads, no distraction on the screen. Minimal interface. \n- Tap on the screen to hide the controls for purer color.\n- Tap on the HEX or RGB value of the color to copy them to clipboard and paste to any other app.\n- Double tap on the screen to add a color to the favorites list.\n- Swipe left on the main screen to retrieve your favorites list.\n- Tapping on a favorite brings up the color on the main screen.\n- Prevents screen from auto-dimming or locking when in use - ideal for long duration usage.\n- Provides a setting to turn up the screen brightness to maximum when in use and return to previous brightness level when the app is quit. \n- Remembers the last used color and starts right as you left it on the next use.\n- Strobe function allows the screen to flash with selected color in order to make it easy to spot.\n- The color of the screen can be changed while in strobe mode.\n\nPlease note that keeping the screen on for long durations or using the device at maximum screen brightness will affect your device's battery life significantly.",

    "description": "AutoWake is the first haptic smart alarm for your Watch. \n\nIt can wake you up by tapping you on your wrist using your Watch's haptic engine. You can set it to wake you if you are in light or medium sleep either 15 or 30 minutes before your set alarm time. This helps you feel more refreshed. \n\nThere's an optional sleep cycle buster that you can turn on to give you a light tap at 5 minute intervals in a 15 or 30 minute window before your alarm to take you gently out of deeper sleep. \n\nNot only that but it will even automatically measure your waking pulse just before the alarm sounds, which is a valuable measurement of recovery.\n\nIf you ignore the alarm on the Watch, you can also set a safety alarm that will play on your phone. This will speak and/or play a chosen song from your music library. \n\nThere's also auto scheduled alarms in case you forget to set your alarm before bed. \n\nIf you use AutoSleep our auto sleep tracker, you can use the new ultra smart alarm features. You can now be woken up after a desired amount of sleep, quality sleep or when your sleep bank is back in credit. You can use this in conjunction with a latest wake time if required. You can even set a bedtime reminder that looks at your required sleep, sleep efficiency and latest wake time to give you a reminder for the optimal time to go to bed. \n\nWhen you turn on your alarm, it can automatically tell AutoSleep that you have gone to bed so that time to fall asleep can be tracked.\n\nIf you use Apple HomeKit then you can run scenes for key events in AutoWake like turning off your bedside lamp and setting your room temperature for sleep. \n\nAutoWake requires an Apple Watch running WatchOS 4 or higher. Advanced features requires WatchOS 5.\n\nAutoWake works fine with Do Not Disturb and Theatre/Cinema mode. \n\nAutoWake requires at least a bluetooth connection between your iPhone and your Apple Watch during the time that you are asleep. You can use Flight Mode on your iPhone, but make sure that you turn on bluetooth.\nIf you user Screen Time, make sure that AutoWake is in your exclude list.\n\nAs with all of our apps, there is no tracking, no analytics, no snooping. Your privacy is very important.",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "Hydra offers innovative photo capture technology, and lets you take beautiful pictures even in the most difficult lighting conditions, which makes it a great companion to iOS Camera app.\n\n“The Hydra app from Belgian company Creaceed is one of the more interesting iOS camera apps we have seen in the recent past.”\n— DPReview\n\n“Hydra is for people who enjoy iPhone photography at a higher and more rewarding level.”\n— David Robinson (iPhonographer)\n\n\"Hydra has the particularity of offering original features, which are missing from many competing apps.\"\n— iPhon.fr\n\nHydra captures more light by merging up to 60 frames to make a single high-quality picture (less noise, more highlights/shadows) on iPhone and iPad. Hydra also goes beyond the 8- or 12-megapixel sensor limit, with up to 32-megapixel high-resolution images. It uses the latest evolutions of iPhone and iPad camera hardware, as well as the latest camera APIs and GPU rendering technologies.\n\nHydra provides 5 specific capture modes: HDR, Video-HDR, Lo-Light, Zoom, and Hi-res modes. \n\n• Hydra's High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is based on an alternate method that captures up to 20 images and that is made to handle even the most difficult lighting conditions. \n• Video-HDR uses single-image tone mapping and device-specific sensor mode to create stunning videos. \n• Lo-Light mode removes sensor noise by merging together multiple images and amplifying light by a factor of 10 to provide a better image quality.\n• Zoom mode uses real-time, super-resolution technique to recreate missing pixels from hand motion, producing 2x, 4x and 8x (telephoto lens) scale factors with more details than the standard digital zooming technique(*).\n• Hi-res mode produces up to 32MP images from the regular 8 or 12MP camera sensor, providing finer details in captured image(*).\n• Hydra supports the telephoto & front cameras respectively in Zoom and Lo-Light/HDR modes to shoot portraits & selfies.\n• Camera support: ultra wide, wide, telephoto, and front facing.\n\nHydra also features a photo gallery for reviewing images and their metadata, directly linked with built-in iOS photo album, thus avoiding duplicates and allowing to flag as favorites.\n\n(*) recommended for static scenes or distant scenery. Rendering artifacts can occur for scenes with parallax and for moving subjects.",

    "description": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****",

    "description": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

    "description": "This professional tool called Clinometer is the most precise (all you can get with some calculations) slope measurement tool for the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad using all sides of the device plus the camera. It can be used for simple applications like aligning a frame as well as for more sophisticated fields of applications where an arbitrary slope needs to be measured exactly. Read the reviews (and write your own) for all the applications you find! Thank for all your positive feedback! Please use our support link if you have questions and suggestions, we don't read the iTunes reviews every day!\n\nWith this tool, the slope can be measured by all edges of the device and through the camera. The current features include:\n\n◆ 3 Modes (incl. auto switching): Clinometer mode (auto when holding upright), Camera mode (any direction, manual activation) and Bubble level (smoothly fading in when holding flat).\n\n◆ Relative angles: Besides measuring absolute angles, for every mode you can measure the relative angle between device positions\n\n◆ Advanced two way calibration on all sides: For every 4 sides plus the bubble mode you can calibrate in two steps, which allows you to calibrate exactly even on non-level surfaces. Each direction can be calibrated individually to achieve the optimal precision. \n\n◆ Speech synthesis: The device will speak the current reading, so you don't have to watch the display while measuring/aligning your object.\n\n◆ Five different unit modes: The device can display the slope in degrees (rounded or in tenth of degrees), percentage, rise over run (common for roof slope measurement in :12) and 1V:H (common in engineering)\n\n◆ Dial Rotation: You can smoothly rotate the background dial and thus define which side of the device represents 0° and 90° degrees. \n\n◆ Motion-sensitive Lock feature: Besides the common instant simple tap hold mechanism you can activate the motion-sensitive lock. If activated the device waits for the final lock until you hold your device steady enough for at least 2 seconds. You can set the lock sensitivity between 0.1° and 1.0° degrees. \n\n◆ Peer Mode: Use two devices to measure angles: One as a display, the other as the measurement device that can be attached to the hardware you want to align. \n\n◆ Fullscreen Mode: The full screen mode can be toggled by tapping the center of the screen and by the upper and lower arrows in the center. This prevents you from erroneous inputs while measuring.\n\n◆ Different color schemes: Press the S/C Button to instantly switch the color. The color can be selected differently for the bubble and the clinometer mode. The predefined color sets include day and night color schemes (Black on White, White on Black and Red). \n\n◆ Adjustable Auto-Lock: You can prevent the device from turning into the sleep mode. \n\nAccording to wikipedia: An inclinometer or clinometer is an instrument for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or inclination of an object with respect to gravity. It is also known as a tilt meter, tilt indicator, slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. \n\nFor recreational use only. After the calibration it CAN (!) be very accurate especially for the main axis after calibration. The measurement is performed as well as possible (we try our best) by using the three inbuilt accelerometers. \n\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT! \n\nWe will improve the application long-term. This was the first application of this kind shortly after the opening of the App Store. Since then it is continuously updated and enriched with new features.",
