Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

    "description": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

    "description": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 13 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync (*) individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nThis wonderful feature allows you to split (*) an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): This feature requires a subscription to Pro Pack®, sold separately from inside the app as an in-app purchase.",

    "description": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!",

You can choose the starting time of the day, that will change dynamically.\r\n\r\nStart the engine, press down on the gas and chase as quickly as possible. Earn points by overtaking traffic cars, you need them to open the new vehicles, modes and other features of the game.\r\n\r\nThis racing simulator gives you the ability to choose the style of driving that can be tranquil and safe or extremely racing. The abundance of settings allows you to customize a level of car physics realism, from arcade and simple to the most realistic, as in the difficult racing simulator in which you will need to show your driving skills.\r\n\r\nRecord your gameplay videos and share them to your friends in social networks with Everyplay Service.

This was inspired by TrueCrypt and makes brute force attacks longer. The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher, key size or cipher mode of operation.\n• Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\n• The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\n• Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.\n\nFor more info see http://www.awallet.org/\n\nIf you like this App, rate it in the App Store.

    "description": "TV Mirror+ for Chromecast is the easy screen sharing tool to mirror your iPhone or iPad screen and sound on Chromecast in Full HD Quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Chromecast.\n\n* Supported Chromecasts: Chromecast, Chromecast Ultra and all generations of the Chromecast family\n\n* Supported TVs and other devices: Xiaomi MI Box, NVIDIA Shield TV and all TVs with Google Cast or Chromecast built-in, e.g. Sony, TCL, Vizio, Sharp, Philips, Hisense, Skyworth, Soniq\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Chromecast must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Google or any other trademark mentioned here. Chromecast is a trademark of Google LLC.",
