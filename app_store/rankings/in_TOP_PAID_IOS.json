    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

    "description": "FiLMiC Remote offers wireless control and monitoring of your FiLMiC Pro experience.  FiLMiC Remote puts your spare iOS devices into the production process.\r\n\r\nRemote v3 offers three modes of capability:  Control, Monitor and Director.\r\n\r\nControl mode provides the familiar FiLMiC Pro interface for complete remote camera control over hard to reach camera placements such as sliders, jib arms, car mounts, microphone stand or other compelling live event camera placements.  Set up your FiLMiC Pro device and then control all settings and recordings from the Remote:\r\n- Start/Stop record functions.\r\n- Focus/exposure reticle placement and locking.\r\n- Dual arc slider manual controls for focus and exposure.\r\n- Pull-to-point focus and exposure pulls.\r\n- Create and load FiLMiC Pro presets from FiLMiC Remote.\r\n\r\nMonitor mode gives you cinema production capability for a fraction of the cost, offering a four-up display with the following powerful analytics:\r\n- Video preview:  Reference video for use with analytics screens.\r\n- Waveform monitor:  Visually identifies signal brightness segmented from left to right across a video feed.  Used in conjunction with the video preview it can provide a quick snapshot of brightness in your video.\r\n- Vectorscope:  Displays color saturation, by channel, across the entire image.\r\n- Histograms:  RGB composite, Luminance,  Zone and RGB channel. \r\n\r\nDirector mode provides a clean video preview.  This is perfect for providing a director, producer or crew with a device to monitor the production remotely. \r\n\r\nYou can switch between modes on the fly to check analytics and composition.  Remote can also be set up in ‘preview-only’ mode allowing a camera operator to perform all controls from the device running FiLMiC Pro and allowing the Remote to be used solely for monitoring.\r\n\r\nCreate your mobile studio today with FiLMiC Remote!\r\n\r\nNotes: \r\n- The use of FiLMiC Remote on one iOS device requires the simultaneous use of FiLMiC Pro on an additional device.  Both devices must be running iOS 12 or later.\r\n- FiLMiC Remote connects to FiLMiC Pro using Wi-Fi either on an established network or using a peer-to-peer network (for using in areas where a Wi-Fi network is not present).\r\n- FiLMiC Remote can connect to any iPhone or iPad running FiLMiC Pro and is not cross platform.",

    "description": "PitchBop is a melodic ear training app designed to help you improve the connection between your ear and your instrument by directly linking the level of skill to the accuracy of your performance.\n\n\nWHAT PITCHBOP DOES DIFFERENTLY\n\nUnlike most ear training apps where you answer by tapping on a screen without addressing the rhythmic aspect of what you hear, PitchBop offers a performance-like scenario where you listen and actually play your instrument or use your voice.\n\nUsing the 'Call and Response' model, Dr. Bop, the resident jazz cat of PitchBop, plays a short phrase for you to listen to and allows you the same amount of time to repeat the phrase back to him to evaluate the accuracy of your performance.\n\n\nHOW PITCHBOP WORKS\n\nBehind the simple interface, there is a complex algorithm based on AI which creates endless melodies and adjusts the difficulty according to your progress.\n\nUsing the 'Call and Response' model, Dr. Bop plays a short phrase for you to listen to and allows you the same amount of time to repeat the phrase back to him to evaluate the accuracy of your performance. Once the session is complete, you receive feedback on how well you did, and the difficulty level is set based on your performance so you can focus on playing without needing to worry about adjusting the settings.\n\n\nAPP FEATURES\n\n+ Pitch Complexity\n\nPitchBop creates calls with varying levels of pitch complexity on a scale of 1 to 9. Use this slider to set the complexity level.\n\n+ Rhythmic Complexity\n\nUse this slider to set the rhythmic complexity level between 1 and 9.\n\n+ Choose Your Instrument\n\nTap the instrument name to see a list of instrument choices, then tap the name of your instrument to automatically set your available range. PitchBop can be used with a wide variety of instruments, including your voice.\n\n+ Metronome Settings \n\nSet the metronome volume and choose if you want it to give you all four beats, one and three, two and four, or whichever combination of beats you prefer.\n\n+ Profile Tab\n\nVisit the Profile Tab to study your progress. This information is only stored for Dr. Bop’s Game, however, not for Practice Mode.\n\nAdditional details can be found by tapping the up and down arrows next to “Scale” to select the various scale and harmony types PitchBop uses for the calls and it will report the success rate and the Pitch and Rhythmic Complexity in your most recent “Call-and-Response” session.\n\n+ Practice Mode settings\n\nPitch Complexity\nRhythmic Complexity\nTempo\nScale\nRange\nAlways start on root on/off\nNumber of calls per session\nSwing/Even\nChromatic notes on/off\n\n\n\nADDITIONAL GAME DETAILS BEFORE YOU START \n\n1. Pay attention to the octave \n\nYour response must be in the same octave as Dr.Bop’s Call in order for it to be registered accurately. If it isn’t, even if the note is correct, you will see a lower score due to the incorrect octave. \n\nExample: For level 1 (when both sliders are all the way to the left) the starting note for the piano is C4 (the middle C). For the guitar, it is C4 as well (first fret on the B string or 5th fret on the G string)\n\n\n\n2. Pay attention to the rhythm\n\nWhile the app may be called PitchBop, rhythm is still a big part of the game. Users should make sure to pay attention to the rhythm and try to be as accurate as they can in matching it. Responses played out of rhythm will lower your score. \n\nIf the Calls feel a little too challenging, you can move the sliders all the way to the left and try starting from there. If this still feels like more than you’re comfortable with for now, you also have the option to go to the “more” tab and adjust the range to be as narrow as an octave.\n\n\n3. Bluetooth and external devices\n\nDue to the diverse and often unpredictable nature of external devices, PitchBop is designed to use the device’s microphone and speaker. \nBluetooth compatibility, however, will be addressed in a future update.\n\nFor any other questions please contact us at support@pitchbop.com",

    "description": "BimmerLink for iOS is the direct link to your BMW or Mini. Using an OBD adapter you can read trouble codes or display sensor values in realtime, check the current state of the DPF in your car or register a new battery after replacement. BimmerLink even allows you to remotely control the exhaust flap or mute the Active Sound Design in your car.\n\nREAD AND CLEAR TROUBLE CODES\nDiagnose your car as would otherwise be possible only by your Service Partner. In contrast to generic OBD apps, BimmerLink allows you to read and clear trouble codes from all control units in your car.\n\nDISPLAY REALTIME SENSOR VALUES\nBimmerLink provides a big selection of values like oil temperature or boost pressure. Keep an eye on all the important parameters of your car with a personalized dashboard.\n\nEXHAUST FLAP REMOTE CONTROL*\nTake control over the exhaust flap in your car and decide yourself, whether it should be closed or open.\n\nACTIVE SOUND DESIGN**\nIf you do not like the artificial engine sound generated in your car, just mute the Active Sound Design with BimmerLink.\n\nSOUND TUNING***\nThe “Sound Tuning” option allows you to disable the “exhaust burble“ in cars equipped with the S55 engine (M2 Competition, M3, M4).\n\nDPF REGENERATION****\nBimmerLink allows you to check the current state of the diesel particulate filter in your car. Find out when the last regeneration took place or how much ash has accumulated in the filter and start a regeneration with the touch of a button.\n\nBATTERY REGISTRATION\nIf you want to replace the battery in your car, this has to be registered in the engine control unit and BimmerLink allows you to do this yourself now.\n\nPARKING BRAKE SERVICE MODE\nBimmerLink allows you to activate the service mode for the electromechanical parking brake.\n\nREQUIRED ACCESSORIES\nTo use the app one of the supported Bluetooth or WiFi OBD adapters is required.

    "description": "iPGMail is an app that implements the OpenPGP standard (RFC 4880, RFC 6637) and allows the user to create and manage both public and private (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, EDDSA, ECDH) PGP keys and send and receive PGP encrypted messages.\n\nPGP Keys and Messages can be passed to iPGMail several ways:\n    * From the iOS Mail.app - The iOS mail application will pass PGP attachments to iPGMail directly, eliminating the need to do an awkward copy-and-paste.  NOTE: PGP messages that are part of the main body of an email will still have to be copy-and-pasted, only properly tagged attachments can be passed automatically.\n\n    * Directly from the system clipboard.  Copy-and-paste the PGP message text from any file, webpage, or message, and it can be imported and decrypted by the app.\n\n    * iTunes File Sharing -  Connect your device to a computer and open up iTunes, in the \"Apps\" section, you can scroll down and select iPGMail under the File Sharing section and transfer files to and from the app to your computer. Make sure device is unlocked before transferring files!\n\n    * AirDrop - Transfer key files from your Mac OS/X system (10.10 or later) to your iPhone/iPad (iOS 7+) using AirDrop feature.\n\n    * DropBox - You can link iPGMail to a dropbox account and transfer files to and from your dropbox file space.  This means you can encrypt and protect your dropbox files or share files with others through your existing dropbox Public interface.\n\n    * Keybase.IO - You can import public keys from http://keybase.io by using the \"+\" button on the public key listing and then searching for users registered in keybase.io.\n\niPGMail now allows you to easily reply to encrypted text-based messages and includes the original text with \"> \" prefixed to the lines.  This allows for more email like conversational exchanges, all with strong OpenPGP cryptographic protection.\n\niPGMail supports PGP key generation (RSA) directly in the app and stores them securely using the iOS keychain for the application.  Using your own private PGP keys, you can encrypt and/or digitally sign any messages.  Optionally, your public key can be attached to any message you send from the app so that the recipient can then import it into their own keychain, either on the phone or on any computer with PGP support.\n\niPGMail will import your private keys so you can reuse your existing PGP identity and keys on your iPhone or iPad.  Both public and private keys can be imported through the interfaces listed above.\n\niPGMail allows the user to search public SKS PGP keyservers to find registered public keys for other people with whom the user can then send email that is digitally signed and/or encrypted encoded in OpenPGP ASCII Armor.\n\nThis app is ideal for securing your files or for sending secure email messages to specific parties without worrying about it being viewed by anyone other than the designated recipient.  \n\nThe OpenPGP standard is described here: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pretty_Good_Privacy",

    "description": "In every facet of business and social life, we are faced with options from which we need to make a strategic decision by undertaking a comparative analysis of available options to arrive at the most favorable decision. We all aspire to be able to make appropriate and informed decisions based on due consideration of key decisive factors. These factors are traditionally categorized into Strengths, Weaknesses Opportunities and Threats or more commonly known as SWOT. \n \nC-SWOT App is a tool that provides users with an instant-results-yielding hybrid of the SWOT Analysis and the Balanced Score Card by way of a visual graphic output. A predefined set of criteria based on the category of decision to be made, are assigned weighted points from a scale. The output provides a graphic representation of how the available Options being compared fare against each other and a decision can then be made to select the most favorable option.\n\nSWOT analysis has been an important strategic planning tool since its inception in the 1960s and has become an established standard among the business community for strategic planning.\n \nNow users are able to carry out SWOT analysis wherever you wish and have the output of your analysis readily available to share with your audience as a presentation slide, print out or transmit by email.\n \nIf you've ever needed to do a SWOT analysis, use them regularly, or are thinking about using one for the first time, then C-SWOT is a must have App.\n\nKey Features :\n* Create custom themes with custom criteria to suit your objective.\n* Create and store multiple objectives.\n* Create multiple options for comparison such as candidates for a specific role, project selection,  holiday or retirement destination.\n* Results are presented within a clear bar chart and comparative data table.\n* Results are exported in standard PDF format in either A4 or US letter size.\n* The PDF document can be either printed directly from the device via Air Print or sent via email.",

    "description": "HeatX  (Heat Exchanger) App is developed mainly to evaluate performance in a shell and tube heat exchanger in terms of its over all heat transfer U-coefficient.  It also helps in determining different maintenance requirement based on change in its performance characteristics due to degradation.  To facilitate continuous monitoring now multiple heat exchanger data can be saved in a file with unique title and can be reloaded as and when required.\n\nManufacturers generally provide design specification data such as heat transfer Area, U-coefficient, effectiveness for a given capacity performance.  However, these values tend to vary over a period of time and often it is necessary to evaluate and compare design specification data with actual performance.   This app serves as a tool for different maintenance personnel, energy and application engineers in monitoring performance and energy efficiency in a shell and tube heat exchanger.\n\nFluid Properties:\nUsers can quickly select different fluids for both shell side and tube side application from a list of most common fluids used in industrial applications.  The key property data such as density and heat capacity is evaluated based on given temperature and pressure for the given fluid.   For fluids that are not in the list, users can create a custom fluid with known property data.  Data can be edited in both SI and USCS unit standards.\n  \nHeat Exchanger Data:\nOne can choose heat exchanger depending upon type of application as well as flows.  Both inside and out side tube heat transfer area can be computed using the tube dimensional data for verification purpose as shown in the following screen shot.\n\nPerformance Summary\nThe over all heat transfer coefficient is computed and presented in the main screen.   The additional result gives different key performance characteristics of a heat exchanger.  App notes has all the definition and brief descriptions of different key parameters presented in the summary.",

    "description": "We are @moment and Pro Camera is the app we’ve always wanted. Manual controls, better video, long exposure and quick access to the settings we need. It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.\n\nFor Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR.

    "description": "Featured in LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\nDa Vinci Eye is the #1 essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat.
