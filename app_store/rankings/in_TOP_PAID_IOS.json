Slow Shutter Cam puts an end to mere snapshots and gives you some of the most powerful features of a DSLR camera. All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.\n \nSlow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:\n \nMOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.\n\nLIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

    "description": "DoubleTake by FiLMiC transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 13 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and 2020.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 13, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nDoubleTake gives you an early look at the multi-cam capability that will be coming to our award-winning cinema camera app FiLMiC Pro.  \n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll.",

Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet.

Enter a hidden temple to discovery a mystery that has taken place there. Solve the puzzles in order to advance - but beware, someone might be watching. Maybe you should have an escape ready? \n\n\nLegacy 3 will test your intelligence and memory. Play slow, think, analyze, and the puzzles will be easier for you solve. \n\nPlay as an young archaeologist who sets out on an adventure to follow his mentor who's gone missing in an ancient pyramid filled with rooms and puzzles. In the pyramid you encounter puzzles and riddles that need to be solved in order to take you to the next room, and hopefully an escape. Connect the dots to solve the hidden secret that lies buried. \n\nI am very proud to present this mystery filled puzzle game. Guessing the solution to a puzzle should not be an option, you need to think before you can advance to the next room.\nA classical point-and-click adventure game with beautiful 3D-graphics and physics-based puzzles that create a new depth to the puzzle and escape room genre. \n\nBEAUTIFUL 3D\nLegacy 3 - The Hidden relic is a beautiful 3d puzzle game.\n\nCHALLENGING PUZZLES\nWhen encountering a new puzzle, think before clicking. This game will reward you for thinking creatively and I always strive towards making the puzzles seem logical. \n\nPICK UP ITEMS AND TAKE PHOTOS\nThe rooms in Legacy 3 are filled with items and clues that are there to help you on your quest. Interact with amazing touch controls to inspect your newly found keys and tools. If you see something that looks interesting you can use your camera and take a photo - of whatever you like! Trying to remember that instruction you saw ten rooms before? No problem - just use the camera and you don't have to!\n\nATMOSPHERE\nHuge and natural looking locations designed with simplicity in mind creates a compelling and mysterious atmosphere. If Legacy 2 - The Ancient Curse was a dark game, this is the opposite. The rooms are big and brighter. But that does not make the puzzles easier. And there are still hidden objects that you need to find in order to solve the puzzles. \n\nWith an inbuilt hint-system you should be able to advance when you get stuck. Some puzzles are more difficult than others and this system should help you get to the next room.\n\n\nI'm a solo indie game developer, if you like to give me feedback or need support do not hesitate to send me an e-mail!\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength. All this data appears on the dash and can be managed with the mode switch, keeping your hands where they belong: on the handlebar.",

    "description": "Recommended and shared by thousands of users! Mentioned as the iOS app to use in:\n  ◆  wired.com - How to Sweep For Bugs and Hidden Cameras\nNote that the app is just a helper tool to induce lens reflection and should be used with common sense and manual inspection of the target object.\n \nProtect your privacy from spy hidden camera lenses. Here are some actual news headlines:\n  ◆  Brits staying in Airbnb flat 'find spy camera hidden pointed at bed'\n  ◆  Oil rig worker files lawsuit: I was secretly recorded\n  ◆  Motel manager accused of setting up hidden camera\n  ◆  Models find hidden cameras in apartment\n\nA free do-it-yourself way of detecting cameras from instructables.com, also based on detecting lens reflections:\n  ◆  Step 1: Find a tube that's good for looking through. A cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper or paper towels is best.\n  ◆  Step 2: All you need is a flashlight or something that you can use to focus a beam of light in a dark room. Attaching a couple of directional LEDs to the outside of the cardboard tube can work also if you don't have a flashlight.\n  ◆  Step 3: With one hand, hold up the toilet paper tube to your eye. With your other hand, hold up the flashlight at about eye level and point it away from you. With one eye, look through the tube and scan the room. If there are any small points of light bouncing back, inspect it further. It might be a camera.\n\nThis app is a tool to help you detect disguised camera lens that you suspect are present in a room. The manual mode with overlay is already equivalent to the do-it-yourself described above or the more expensive hardware camera detector gadgets that tries to detect using the tell-tale signs of tiny reflections of hidden camera lenses. The good thing is this app is always with you, ready when you need it.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS for the APP: \n\nUse this tool after your own visual inspection and investigation. Scan the room first without your phone and once you find something suspicious point the phone camera to the suspected object. The app alternately turns on and off the camera flash to detect the signature of a camera lens. Carefully adjusting the distance and angle relative to the target object helps as well adjusting the level of lighting in the room.\n\nWhen automatic mode is ineffective or distracting you should use manual mode. In both manual and automatic modes you must use your own judgment as this is just a tool like what you would do with an expensive hidden camera detector gadgets or the do-it-yourself detector described above.\n\nMANUAL Detection: \nAnytime that you see the signature of a camera lens you can single-tap on the screen and put a marker on the suspected camera lens.\nYellow overlay - this signifies that the surface might be metallic or glass-like and that a great amount of reflectivity is being detected.\nCyan overlay - this means that the surface is changing in color consistent with the general hue of camera lenses.\n\nAUTOMATIC Detection: \nThe app will continuously try its best to put a marker where it assesses a camera lens may be present. To exclude surfaces that are generating lots of false positives you can zoom the camera or carefully change the distance or angle of the phone to the target. Works best when room lights are dimmed and the phone is very steady.\n\nBONUS 1: EMF scanner to detect the slight magnetic field present in electronic devices including hidden spy cameras. \nBONUS 2: Some home cameras broadcast bluetooth information and this app has a scanner for bluetooth devices.\n\nBE SAFE and START SCANNING!",

    "description": "Sugar is in everything these days, from boxed cereals to pasta sauces; it's almost impossible to avoid unless you're eating a real food diet. The 7 Day Sugar-Free Detox was designed by the Young and Raw team of expert nutritionists and holistic health coaches to create a fun and cleansing experience for you while you break free from the chains of sugar. \n\nStudies show sugar can be highly addictive, so rest assured we've got your back when it comes to kicking it for good! Inside this detox, you're going to find two meal plans to choose from. Our Low-Sugar Plan has small amounts of natural sugar found in fruits. Our No-Sugar Plan is completely sugar free.\n\nRefined or processed sugar is incomplete in its nutrient profile, lacking minerals and vitamins required by our bodies for digestion. What ends up happening when we eat sugar, is our bodies have to seek out the proper minerals required for digestion and unfortunately, those minerals are \"borrowed\" from our mineral reserves. This can lead to mineral deficiency and other health issues that are today, considered \"modern diseases\". \n\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox is designed to support:\n- Breaking sugar addiction\n- Weight loss\n- Liver & Kidney detox\n- Skin health \n- Balancing blood sugar \n- Mood balancing\n- Energy levels\n- Adrenal fatigue\n\nInside the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox you will find:\n- Low-Sugar Meal Plan which includes some fruit sugars\n- No-Sugar Meal Plan which is 100% sugar free\n- Recipes - along with a list of health benefits for each recipe\n- Shopping lists - to make shopping quick and easy, you can tick off items from the list\n- Morning and evening routines - including how to get a perfect night of sleep\n- Young and Raw's favorite books, quotes & documentaries\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the plan work to reset the body?\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox was carefully crafted by experts to get you results while maintaining your sanity throughout the process! \n\nBy replacing sugar with fresh leafy greens, vegetables, seaweeds and seeds along with an abundance of healthy fats, your body will be less hungry for sugar. In the beginning, you may notice a withdrawal period as your body adjusts to running off of fat and real food rather than sugar and carbohydrates. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, it's not easy, but we know you can do it!\n\nThe meal plans have everything you need to detox, and because there are no added or refined sugars your liver and kidneys will get a much needed break from processed sugar.\n\nFor 7 days you're going to experience what it's like to enjoy only real, whole foods but don't forget that diet is only one part of the equation. Proper detox also includes getting enough fresh clean water and optimizing your sleep. Our sleep cycles ensure the body gets its time to effectively detox, renew and heal. The included sleep protocol was designed based on all of the information we have about the importance of optimized sleep and the experiments we have done, to create a protocol that really works. \n\nYour herbal protocol is always optional and if you're on any medications, pregnant or have a health condition, it's advised that you speak with your physician and consult an herbalist prior to taking new supplements. The herbal protocol is minimal yet powerful, including some of the most elite herbs for detoxing the liver, kidneys, creating clear skin and boosting energy in the process. \n\nIn Summary, the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox helps to reset the body by:\n- Gently cleansing the body and promoting toxin elimination\n- Gently introducing blood cleansing foods\n- Providing the body with enough healthy fats to begin removing a reliance upon sugar and processed carbohydrates\n- Encouraging a healthy sleep cycle \n- Creates a movement routine to stimulate the lymphatic system, the endocrine system and the detox organs\n- Hydrating effectively to flush the body of excess toxins and create electrolyte balance",

    "description": "A comprehensively featured calculator that has quickly become a favourite among adults and primary schools around the world. Designed for a wide range of users, this calculator has large colourful buttons, optional high contrast, full VoiceOver support, and unique to this calculator; the option to use speech for answers, button names and formulas!\n\n*** Showcased by Apple Australia at the Association of Special Education Administrators in Queensland Inc. Conference 2011 *** \n\n\"We have found it particularly useful to students with developmental delays.\" \n- Apple (Australia) \n\nIf you’re looking for a talking calculator with scientific or fraction operators, then please look for this app's big brother, the Talking Scientific Calculator. \nIf you're looking for statistics functionality, then please check out the new Talking Statistics Calculator app.\n\nTalking Calculator's features include:\n-------------------------------------------------\n- Select between two user-interfaces: standard calculator, and ultra-simple, which is ideal for young children.\n\n- Reads answers, entered numbers and formulas aloud. For example:\n  1,234.56 is spoken as \"One thousand, two hundred and thirty four point five six.\"\n\n  2 + 5 x 3^2 is spoken as \"two plus five multiply three squared\"\n\n- Two entry modes, Standard and Formula. Standard mode emulates traditional calculators: You need to be mindful of the 'order of operations'. Formula mode takes care of the order of operations for you. You enter a mathematical expression, complete with operators and parentheses (brackets), tap the EQUALS button, and the expression is evaluated. This is similar to using formulas in Microsoft Excel. \n\n- Paper log feature, designed particularly for classroom use. Calculations are recorded with a timestamp and can be viewed or emailed.\n\n- Built in recording studio and script. Requires only 5 minutes to record a new voice. Recordings can be transferred between devices using Bluetooth. \n\n- Supports VoiceOver standard and touch-typing input styles. Speaks numbers and formulas naturally, not as sequences of digits. Magic Tap can be used to speak with the built-in or custom recorded voice.\n\n- The entire app is accessible to VoiceOver and Switch Control users, including the recording studio for recording your own voice and the use of complex formulas. \n\n- International number formats\n\n- Optional high contrast mode (black on yellow)\n\n\nCustomisable for each level of vision:\n--------------------------------------------\n\nNormal to low vision: Large, clear buttons with optional speech.\nLow vision: High contrast display mode, with optional speech.\nNo vision / blind: VoiceOver reads the button names before they are activated. The calculation results are spoken.\n\n\nWhy record new voices?\n--------------------------------------------\n\nHaving your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch talk with your own voice, or that of a friend or tutor will make the calculator sound more natural to you. The calculator will speak with the accent you are used to hearing. Note also that the VoiceOver feature built into your device, while awesome, is not good at reading out large and small numbers. \n\nIt can also be fun to experiment with silly voices.\n\nHow good is the sound quality of recorded voices?\n\nExcellent: The microphone in your iPad, iPhone or iPod Touch is of very good quality, and this calculator performs digital signal processing to ensure the audio level is consistent across all recorded words.",

    "description": "GeoShred Play Version 5, is an exciting update, now with In-App-Purchases for GeoSWAM instruments on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater.\n\nWith GeoShred Play, everyone can shred using the new diatonic playing surface!  You can Shred the Blues and never hit a wrong note.  Slide your finger in any direction and let the magic happen using a scale that fits perfectly against a backing track.  Seamlessly move between fretless and diatonic modalities in a magical musical way using our isomorphic and diatonic playing surface and groundbreaking intelligent pitch rounding.\n\nGeoShred Play is a play-only version of the award-winning GeoShred musical instrument for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch. GeoShred Play can be used to perform GeoShred Pro presets.\n\nIt's a great way to get started with GeoShred, AND it can be upgraded to ALL of the powerful GeoShred Pro features like preset editing, AUv3 plugin support, MIDI/MPE, and setlist editing.  GeoShred Play can also purchase GeoSWAM IAP instruments. \n\nGold Medal Winner of the 2019 Denny Award, winner of a 2019 Guthman New Musical Instrument Award, and winner of the 2017 Electronic Musician Editor's Choice Award as \"one of the most innovative, groundbreaking products to emerge in the past twelve months\".  \n\nGeoShred’s performance surface with “almost magic” pitch rounding algorithms is coupled with a model of the physics of strings. It’s a fusion of Jordan Rudess’ performance concepts and moForte’s powerful, modeled guitar/effects based on the Physical Modeling research of Dr. Julius O. Smith III of Stanford/CCRMA. \n\nGeoShred Play Features Include:\n• A fluidly expressive playing surface + a Physically modeled guitar\n• A diatonic keyboard where every key on the screen is in the scale.\n• Support for backing tracks\n• 3D touch on devices that support 3D touch.\n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus support.\n\n---\n \nPraise for the GeoShred family of apps: \n\n“GeoShred is brilliant- it’s a real instrument.” – Eddie Jobson\n\n“A fantastic new invention which is going to revolutionize the way music is played, expressed and learned! “GeoShred” is one of the foremost best musical inventions I’ve had the pleasure to experience in recent years. Definitely 5 stars out of 5! GIGANTASTIVISSIMO…..R…A…Z !!!!!” – Patrick Moraz\n\n“That’s just nuts. You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.  It would mean a lot to us if you could leave your positive review on the App Store and If you have any questions about GeoShred we would love to hear from you at our support email address: support@moforte.com \n\n---\nMinimum Requirements:  iOS 11.4 or better is required for AUv3 support and GeoSWAM instruments.\n***Note: The GeoSWAM instruments can ONLY be performed from the GeoShred keyboard or MPE controllers.\n***Note: Unfortunately, due to App Store limitations, previously purchased instrument IAPs can not be applied to a purchase of the collection IAP. \n***Note: The Pro upgrade is to the functionality of GeoShred Pro.  The app is still GeoShred Play, but it has all the Pro features and is identical to GeoShred Pro",

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

It takes advantage of price correlation between various Forex pairs. Currency strength is measured for 8 currencies (USD, JPY, EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, CHF & CAD) and is reported on a scale of 0 (weakest) to 10 (strongest). \n\nCurrency strength data provides the trader with important insights into the forces at play causing a move on a particular Forex pair. For example, if GBP/USD suddenly trends upwards following an economic news announcement (e.g. US Non-Farm Payroll), the currency strength values would immediately indicate whether the move was due to generalized GBP strength or USD weakness.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nStreaming currency strength data feed - fast updates, low latency. Accurate and reliable\n\n8 currencies and 4 currency strength time-frames. Currency strength resolution down to 1 min on lower time-frames.\n\nBar Chart. Multiple time-frames, history viewer feature, real-time max/min highlighting.\n\nLine Chart. For real-time and historical data. Multiple time-frames, zoom.

    "description": "L'Ecorché is a groundbreaking, intuitive tool developed by artists, for artists to reference anatomy. It's not a book, it's not a sculpture. It's an elegant and painstakingly-detailed fusion of the two that takes the best of both and brings them into a whole new medium for learning.\n\nOriginally developed by animation sculptor Michael Defeo as a personal reference tool for his courses with anatomy expert Scott Eaton, this application has grown from a simple sculpture for the iPad into a fully-developed application for iPad, iPhone, Mac desktop.\nWorking with world-renowned anatomy expert Scott Eaton, Michael has designed an intuitive app that features classical, educational and instructional versions of Jean-Antoine Houdon's iconic \"écorché.\" \n\nRather than simply looking at a book or a sculpture, the artist can now: \n\n* tumble and zoom the model from 360 degree angles; \n* switch to Scott's updated version which keeps the original grace while providing anatomical corrections; \n* toggle an informational overlay which will reveal a full muscular map that includes text indicating origin, inserts and actions. \n* In addition, Scott is overseeing Michael's planar and primitive versions that will help the artist better understand the forms at play, with both artists working tirelessly to ensure maximum correctness, elegance, intuition and usability.\n\n* This is not a posable figure. Rather, think of it as having this classic sculpture on your device.",

    "description": "Break-ups suck, but you needn’t suck at break-ups. Break-Up Boss offers advice and techniques to help the broken-hearted process their hurt, heal, and ultimately, see their break-up as the gift it is. Become the boss of your break-up. Own it.\n \nCreated by the author of Textbook Romance, and long-time relationship columnist at Cosmopolitan, Zoë Foster Blake, and with illustrations by Mari Andrew, Break-Up Boss is a modern, meaningful, big-hearted tool for the broken-hearted.\n \nHow does it differ from other break-up tools? Because Break-Up Boss firmly places YOU in charge of your break-up. Because you ARE in charge of it! And only you are. Stop letting your heartache and your ex take over your life, your diet, your social life, your job and personality, and start seeing your circumstances as an opportunity for growth. Break-ups happen cos something was broken. So fix yourself, love yourself, and move forward. \n\nBreak-Up Boss is the size of a self-help book, but WAY easier to use and digest. (A boss works smart, not hard, after all.) It reveals a no BS, non-waffly, non-naff, real-life strip down of the modern break-up, and enthusiastically encourages an empowered, big-picture, positive view of how to deal with one. \n\nFeatures include:\n\n- Use the Feel Wheel to read the exact advice you need at the exact time you need it…. because no two break-ups follow the same time line or even a reliable pattern, after all. (Are you about to see your ex at a wedding? Are you drunk and about to send them a text? Are you miserable and wanting to get back with them? We’ve got you!)\n\n- Send a fake text to your ex, so you don’t send an ACTUAL text to them, and screw everything up (or your ex)\n\n- Recieve daily pep-peps direct to your phone, so you’ve got some sunshine, power and perspective in your pocket at all times\n\n- SOS quotes that give you the exact advice, just as you need it. Like Goddess cards, only less… Goddessy.\n\nBreak-ups are a normal, inevitable part of life. And yet we are so bad at them. We let them completely hijack our lives, even though they force us to watch rubbish movies, and cry a lot, and forgo sleep, and eat rubbish.\n\nWell no more. Because now you can own your break-up like a boss. And you really, really should.\n\nBreak-Up Boss is proud to donate 10% of every sale to Safe Steps, a family violence response centre in Victoria, Australia.\n\n\"I just broke up with my boyfriend like literally 30 minutes ago and I'm already laughing. Thank you! I am looking forward to going through the shitty range of feelings with this baby beside me!\" - Sandy\n\n\"I love the app! It's so great to feel loved and supported and not feel like you are over relying on friends (who have their own lives of course).\" - Madison, VIC",

    "description": "A magnetometer utility app designed by magicians for magicians.\n\nFrom the creators of Email Wizard (an amazing app acquired by the legendary David Copperfield).\n\nIf your magic routines include magnets, this app is for you.  Simply put, MagSense is a utility app that will tell you when a magnet is within the range of the magnetometer.  Unlike other magnetometer apps currently available, this app is designed to be stealth, so the spectator will not know that an app is in use.  You can set the app to vibrate when a magnet is in range, use a small visual cue in the corner of the screen which can be set to black (so the device appears to be asleep) or a screenshot of your choosing.\n\nSimple to use, takes just minutes to set up.  MagSense should be considered a utility app, and is not a magic trick by itself.  You should use this app to enhance your current performance.  This app is not for beginner magicians/mentalist.  You should already know the basics to incorporate this into your performance.\n\nIncludes three suggested routines written by Columbian mentalist Mauricio Jaramillo.\n\nA magnet is required for routines (not included).  This app is for entertainment purposes only and does not provide any real mind reading abilities.",

    "description": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!",

    "description": "The best camera is the one you have with you. But what if that camera was improved with pro features, a gorgeous interface, intuitive controls, and was always with you?\n\nThat camera is Obscura.\n\n\nCamera\n————————————————\nObscura is designed to make it fast and easy to capture stunning images. Whether you're shooting in portrait or landscape, the Control Wheel fits into your hand perfectly. You won't be fumbling around trying to capture a photo when you're in a hurry – everything is accessible with one thumb. Finely tuned haptic feedback gives the devices a sense of physicality, so you can feel every adjustment.\n\nFormat\n————\nYou can shoot in a wide range of formats:\n\n• RAW - capture more details and allow for a greater amount of flexibility when editing.\n\n• HEIC - a new image format that uses advanced compression for high quality files at smaller sizes.\n\n• JPEG - You can never really go wrong with JPEG, can you? It just works everywhere.\n\n• Live Photo - combine high resolution photos with video clips that bring your images to life.\n\n• Depth - allows you to apply exciting portrait mode effects and more.\n\n\nFilters\n————\nObscura includes a bunch of gorgeous filters to add style to your images. \nThere are 19 included filters, perfect for a wide range of scenes.\n\n• A Sepia filter unlocked by sharing the app with friends\n\n• A Black & White filter pack, including 8 filters. Especially good for dealing with low light and striking architecture.\n\n• An Analogue filter pack, including 7 filters. These work great for giving a cinematic look to your images.\n\n\nOther Camera Features\n————\nObscura has all the features you expect in a great camera app, including:\n• Flash control\n• Grids\n• Shutter Timer\n• Spirit Level\n\n\nLibrary\n————————————————\nWith a single swipe you can browse your library. \nBut Obscura doesn’t just have a simple image browser, it’s much more powerful than that. Here’s what you can do:\n\n• Edit - Apply Obscura’s gorgeous filters to images you’ve just captured (or images from other, lesser camera apps). You can save the filtered image as an adjustment, or as a new copy. \n\n• Share - There’s a good old share sheet, so you can share with your friends, and open images in other apps.\n\n• Copy - quickly copy an image to the clipboard, so you can share it with ease.\n\n• Favourite - Mark an image as favourite. Simple.\n\n• Hide - Not every image is for everyone to see. It’s cool. We get it.\n\n• Delete - Goodbye forever little photo.\n\n• Trash - Obscura has a neat little feature where you can add photos to a special trash album, so you can delete them all in one go. Efficient. \n\n\nSettings\n————————————————\nWith a wide range of customisation options, Obscura works your way. You can change the effects of gestures, secondary capture formats, and even the app icon! \n\n\nPrivacy\n————————————————\nWe believe that your personal information belongs to you. Obscura doesn’t collect any information about you, so there’s nothing to share with third parties, nothing can be hacked or leaked, because we don’t have it. We think that’s best for everyone. \n\nThe only data we see is the opt-in analytics that’s automatically collected by iOS. See more about it at apple.com/privacy\n\n\nExtras\n————————————————\nObscura has a Notification Center widget, which makes it quick and easy to access the app from the lock screen.\n\nPress firmly on the app icon on your home screen to quickly jump to some of Obscura’s features.\n\n\nRequirements\n————————————————\nNot all features are available on every device :( \n\nFocus Peaking - requires iPhone 6 or newer\nRAW capture - requires iPhone 6S or newer\nHEIC capture - requires iPhone 7 or newer\nDepth Capture - requires Dual Camera (iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X)\nAdvanced Haptic Feedback - requires iPhone 7 or newer\n\n\n————————————————\n\n\nMade by Ben Rice McCarthy\nhttp://www.benricemccarthy.com/\n\nMore info at\nhttp://obscura.camera",
