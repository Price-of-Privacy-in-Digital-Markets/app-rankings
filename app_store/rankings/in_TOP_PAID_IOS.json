    "description": "If you've ever wanted to use your iPhone camera as a video & audio input to stream using OBS Studio, we've got you covered. We've tried all the apps that let you do it over WiFi, but they're not fast enough, so we also allow you to use a wired USB connection.\n\nQUALITY VIDEO\nYour iPhone/iPad camera's are good, really good. In fact, there’s no comparison between the highly recommended streaming webcam, the Logitech C922 HD Pro and the iPhone 6 Camera. Stream Landscape or Portrait video.\n\nAUDIO\nIf you don't have a separate mic for your streaming setup, you can now use the microphone on your iOS device to stream audio & video.\n\nFRONT CAMERA\nStream a selfie with the front camera support. Switch anytime during the stream with the familiar camera switch button.\n\nTAP TO FOCUS, PINCH TO ZOOM\nControls just like you're used to from the Camera app.\n\nMANUAL CONTROLS\nTake control of the focus, exposure, white balance as you would on a manual DSLR camera.\n\nLOW LATENCY\nStream video over a wired USB connection. This avoids the issue of delay over wifi, as many other solutions suffer from. This is just as fast as a USB webcam!\n\nUSB & WIFI\nChoose the connection type. If you want low latency, use USB, if you'd like portability then use WiFi. WiFi is done using the NewTek™ NDI® protocol, so you can use Camera for OBS Studio with any NewTek™ NDI® compatible receiver.\n\nMULTIPLE DEVICES\nIf you're lucky enough to own multiple iOS devices, use them together and produce a multi-camera stream.\n\nMAC AND PC\nSupports OBS Studio running on macOS and Windows.\n\nYou will need to install the OBS Studio iOS Camera Plugin from our website, or use an NDI compatible receiver to use this app.\n\nFor the best possible experience make sure you device is listed on our website https://obs.camera/docs/faqs/#what-ios-hardware-do-i-need",

    "description": "AirBeam turns your iDevices into a realtime audio and video surveillance system. AirBeam streams live video and audio from the cameras and microphones of iPhones, iPods, iPads. You can watch the stream on any other iDevice, Mac, Web browser or AppleTV - even on multiple screens simultaneously.\n\nUse your iDevices as luxury babyphones, for serious surveillance, to keep an eye on your pets, a FPV cam in your remote controlled toys…there are hundreds of useful and not so useful things you can do with it. Even if you have just a single device AirBeam is an awesome tool for motion controlled video recording.\n\nAirBeams features in detail:\n* High Quality Realtime: Watch video and hear audio on your remote device in amazing quality with resolution up to Full-HD 1080p, 30 frames per second and CD quality audio. Watch and hear in realtime thanks to AirBeam's low latency encoding and transmission technology.\n\n* Zero Configuration: No need to manually configure device addresses. AirBeam automatically discovers all AirBeam cams on your network and you can instantly watch them.\n\n* Multi Camera, Multi Monitor: Launch as many camera devices as you want and monitor them simultaneously. Or follow a single camera on multiple screens at the same time. On an iPad you can watch up to four cameras at a time.\n\n* Recording: Seeing or hearing something on AirBeam you want to remember? Just press the record button and the video and audio will be recorded. You can also capture still images.\n\n* Motion and audio detection: Trigger alarms or recordings when something happens in front of the camera to create a single track of events that happened during a day.\n\n* Dropbox integration (requires iOS>=9): Uploads recordings directly to your Dropbox account.\n\n* Web interface: Use a browser to watch (no audio in a browser) the live video, download your recordings or adjust the camera settings.\n\n* Two-way audio: Audio streaming works both ways so that you can also talk through the camera device.\n\n* Full remote control: Adjust all camera settings and access to your photo and video library remotely from the monitor device.\n\n* Virtual reality mode: Render the video stream in stereo for watching with a virtual reality headset such as the FreeFlyVR orCardboard.\n\n* Motrr Galileo supported: Remotely pan and tilt your iPhone camera when mounted in a Galileo robotic motion platform.\n\n* AND COMPLETELY FOR FREE: AirBeam viewer app for Mac and AppleTV available in the Mac and AppleTV AppStore.\n\nImportant notes\n=============\n* Best video quality is achieved when AirBeam is used within a local WiFi network. With port forwarding configured in your WiFi router it is also possible to monitor AirBeam cameras on your WiFi at home from anywhere in the Internet. Do do this you need to configure a port forwarding for port 8123 in your WiFi router - see the FAQ pages on our homepage for more details. And check your data plan, live video over cellular consumes quite some bandwidth...\n* Please consider regulations for video surveillance in your country.",

    "description": "Run 10km (6.2 miles) with this simple series of interval workouts designed to gradually build your endurance. The Run 10k app is perfect for beginner runners and former runners who want to start running again. This app has voice cues that guide you even when your screen is locked. The app tells you when to run and walk and gives audio cues for distance and pace when you use GPS. You can use this app outside, on a track, or in the gym.\n\nFEATURES\n• Apple Watch app—you can leave your phone at home while you workout with our Watch app, or continue to use our Watch app together with the iPhone app.\n• Speaks pace, distance, intervals, and halfway point. \n• Optionally uses GPS for pace and distance. (You can also use this app on a treadmill or indoor track without GPS.)\n• Animated, spoken stretching programs.\n• Tap out your heart rate on the heart icon.  \n• Supports Bluetooth heart rate monitors.\n• Integrates with the Health app.\n\nABOUT the WORKOUTS\n• 13-week training program for beginners.\n• Each workout ranges from 40 to 76 minutes long.\n• Interval training alternates between jogging and walking.\n• Workout intervals gradually become more challenging.\n• Tapers in the last week for your 10k race.\n• 5-minute warmup and 5-minute cooldown, which are optional.\n• Speaks each jog and walk interval, the halfway mark, and 1-minute-left mark.\n• Optionally speaks pace and distance information every mile or km.\n• Automatically checks off each completed workout and records your date, pace, and distance. \n\nCOMING FROM RUN 5K?\nIf you’ve completed our Run 5k app and you're feeling good, you can start on Week 4 or 5 of our Run 10k app to continue your training. If you’re a couch potato, start from Week 1, or check out our Run 5k app first.\n\nAUDIO CUES and NOTIFICATIONS\nIf you’re not getting Notifications in the background, open the Settings app, select Notifications, then scroll down to find Run 10k in the list. Tap on Run 10k and turn on Notification Center, choose an alert style, and turn everything else on (Sound, Badge App Icon, Lock Screen).

    "description": "*** PLEASE READ **** \nEnso is an AudioUnit V3 plugin; it requires an AUv3 host like Cubasis, Garageband, AUM, etc. THERE IS NO STANDALONE APP; it is only a container for the AUv3.\n\nAn architecturally unique and sonically characterful looping toolkit for producers and live performers, inspired by both modern looper pedals and vintage tape-based setups, Enso combines elegant and intuitive UI design with a deep but accessible feature set and stellar sound quality.\n\nEnso’s operation will be immediately familiar to users of hardware looper pedals or plugins such as Ableton Live’s bundled Looper. Start playback of the host DAW, hit Enso’s record button and capture your instrumental performance into a loop of whatever length you like, up to ten minutes (five minutes on iOS). Then, without stopping playback, overdub further passes to create layered grooves, complex harmonic textures, or dense, evolving soundscapes.\n\nBeyond those basics, though, Enso takes software looping into new territory. Two Overdub modes configure the plugin for conventional looper pedal behaviour or Frippertronics-style ‘dual tape deck’ manoeuvres, affecting the handling of the Feedback parameter for an endless range of layering possibilities; and up to four Sectors can be effortlessly defined, each with its own start and end points, for on-the-fly rearrangement of the loop.\n\nWith Enso, time and motion become truly fluid, as speed and direction are handled completely independently for playback and recording, the ‘through-zero’ bipolar Speed controls smoothly transitioning from forwards to backwards, and vice versa, in real time. Want to record forwards at half speed, while simultaneously playing the buffered loop in reverse at 1.25x? Of course you do…\n\nOnboard tape-style saturation, filtering and chorus effects bring dirt, frequency-shaping and stereo thickening to the party; and a comprehensive MIDI assignment system makes it a snap to set your MIDI pedal or button controller up for operation of all Enso’s buttons and switches. With its animated play and record heads, meanwhile, the looping waveform display provides a clean, clear visual representation of the potentially mind-bending temporal acrobatics taking place, letting you get a handle on exactly what’s happening at a glance.\n\nGiving you everything you need for limitlessly creative looping, on stage and in the studio, Enso is one of Audio Damage’s most beautifully realized plugins yet, and an empowering addition to any musician’s arsenal of effects",

Every day you’ll have the opportunity to check in, take your emotional temperature, practice prayer and meditation, read the AA Big Book, complete a daily inventory, set reminders to call your sponsor, do step writing, show up for service commitments and more. \n\nCTB will help you strengthen your AA program and be of service to others. A life of sane and happy usefulness is what we are promised and is available to you right now. \n\nUsers love CTB, “Finally everything I’ve been looking for in one place...and with a cute graphic design interface,” and report using it daily, “A virtual recovery buddy that is absolutely true to the program.” \n\nDetailed features include:\n\nCheck in: Take your emotional temperature three times a day.\n\nSteps: All 12 AA steps, including prompts for writing on each step.\n\nTraditions: All 12 AA traditions, including the long form of each one.\n\nTools: All 7 AA tools, and the opportunity to set reminders to use them.\n\nProgress: Sobriety counter and chips for length of abstinence from alcohol and drugs.\n\nGoals: Set goals for the day, reminders for appointments, medications, meetings, and more.\n\nBig Book: The second edition of the AA Big Book including all stories and appendixes available at that time. \n\nWriting: Prompts for daily writing exercises: Gratitude list, God letter, Plan of Action, the Bedevilments, and more.\n\nEmail: You can email writing and your weekly list of accomplishments to anyone you wish.\n\nSometimes it’s hard to reach people, but you can always reach for the phone and find CTB. This app is not intended to replace a sponsor relationship or going to meetings, but rather as a compliment to your existing AA program. We were never meant to recover in isolation and we hope this tool will help you grow in your AA recovery and fellowship.\n\nWe charge a one-time download fee, do not track your information, and you will never see an advertisement while using the app. If you have suggestions for improvement, please feel free to contact us at info@odaatproductions.com.",

AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning.\n\nEven if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.\n\nIf you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher.

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat. Also their support is brilliant, they responded in less than an hour of the query I emailed to them.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

When played as a solo instrument, the tabla is accompanied (usually on the harmonium or sarangi) by a continuous cyclical musical phrase or riff called the \"Lehra\" or \"Nagma\" (ostinato in western music) that keeps track of the \"aavartan\" or rythmic cycle in the chosen \"taal\".\n________________________________________\n\n◆ AND NOW PRESENTING - iLehra ◆\niLehra was the first electronic Lehra / Nagma player for the iPhone and iPod Touch, and its now available on the iPad as well! It provides accurate as well as pleasing lehra accompaniment for a wide variety of taals and raags on the Harmonium, Santoor, Violin, or the Flute. Innovative features include tanpura auto-tuned to the chosen lehra/raag, presets, tap-tempo, metronome, and extremely intuitive controls.\n\nSee the iLehra website for a YouTube demo:\n   http://iLehra.com\n________________________________________\n\n◆ KEY FEATURES ◆\n√ Plays 109 Lehras in 55+ raags for 25 taals\n√ Taals included:  Ada Chautaal(14), Basant Taal(9), Chartal-ki-Sawari(11), Chautaal(12), Dadra(6), Deepchandi(14), Dhamar(14), Ektaal(12), Faradost/Firdost(14), Ganesh Taal(21), Jhaptaal(10), Jhoomra(14), Keherva(8), Matta Taal(9), Pancham Sawari(15), Rudra Taal(11), Rupak(7), Sooltaal(10), Teentaal(16), as well as general lehras for 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 13, and 18 beats.\n√ Beautiful, realistic lehras on Harmonium, Violin, Flute, or Santoor!\n√ Full octave of pitch adjustments from C through B\n√ INTEGRATED AUTO-TUNER: Auto-Tune iLehra to your tabla, or use it to tune other instruments (microphone capability required such as iPhone built-in mic or 2nd/3rd generation iPod Touch with external microphone)\n√ BACKGROUND PLAY: Start playing the lehra and switch to another app, or play along with iPod music\n√ TAP TEMPO: just tap the beats on the bottom display and watch iLehra sync up!\n√ PRESETS: save your frequently-used combinations of pitch, taal, lehra, instrument & tempo as named presets.

Explore other genres of rhythm or create your own beats and share with your friends! Use the “Live” mode to provide the tala in real time in a Bhajan or Bharatanatyam setting. \n\nAs quoted in \"The Illustrated Companion To South Indian Classical Music\" by Ludwig Pesch: \n         \"A musician or dancer needs to acquire an ability to maintain an even tempo \n          (kalapramanam) if the finer nuances of rhythm are to be mastered\" \n\nKeep up with a perfect beat, choose your tala with ease, and learn about Carnatic Talas along the way with Talanome!\n\nWith Talanome, you get:\n\n* Precision Sound Engine giving you precise timing at any tempo!\n\n* 181 Talas, including\n   * all 175 Suladi Sapta Talas (the main system of Talas in Carnatic Music today)\n   * 6 Chapu Talas (Tisra, Khanda, Misra, Viloma, Sankeera & Rupaka Chapu)\n\n* “Make Your Own Talas” - explore more exotic talas (like Ashtottara Sata talas, Melakartha talas), beats from other genres of music, or any beats you can conceive off, by transcribing them easily! Talanome comes preloaded with all 108 Ashtottara Sata Talas, Dr. M.Balamuralikrishna's Mukhi Talas, a Fibonacci Tala,  talas that Pete Lockett, a world renowned multi-percussionist, created and has kindly shared with us, and now, Hindutani Taals! Importing and exporting talas are a breeze, and you can share easily via email. It supports fractional beats and creating smaller \"Tala Phrases\" which you can use and reuse in your beat pattern - this affords even greater control and ease over creating any beat pattern you like!\n\n* Choose from 20 to 350 Aksharas per minute, with fine-grained control over tempo and the ability to easily change the Kalam by speeding up or slowing down the tempo by a factor of 2. \n\n* With the “Tap Tempo” feature, you can tap out the rhythm and Talanome will set it to the appropriate value!\n\n* Count In support to help get the Talam started\n\n* Nadai(Gathi) & Kalai support. Play the Talam with/without Nadai! Play it at different Kalais!\n\n* Keep track of the beat and follow along with a visual representation of the Talam and bold beat numbers or counting phrases (like Thekas) - switch between different representations by double tapping the Tala Visualizer. \n\n* Rich sound options: \n   * Great natural sound derived from a real Manjira and Nattuvangam \n   * Select from a pitch of 1 kattai (C) all the way to 7 kattai (B)\n   * Choose a hand clapping sound for a shruti neutral sound\n   * Ability to play alternate nadai sounds (mimicking Chapu talam voicings) \n\n* Talanome supports background play and keeps playing even when minimized.

    "description": "When we chant we use our vocal apparatus to produce the sound. The process brings us into the eternal NOW. When we write, a long lapse of time can pass between the time of writing and our re-reading. When we chant, the action brings us in the present moment. The process of chanting demands full attention, at least on the physical level. There is also the question of resonance. Chanting evokes and invokes resonance in letters and words. All mantra can be chanted in three forms, the vachika form(chanting externally, uttering sound) is the between, and the lalitha is the grossest.Yet, this requires full knowledge of what one is doing. It follows that when we chant we are in the NOW, we are vibrating, and we know what we are uttering so that when we move to the subtlest plane.",

This is not a game. You are controlling flying RC models that reacts like real flying models. It takes some time to learn, and again, do not expect \"arcade\" style controls.\n2. The onscreen control sticks are just indicators! They are made small so they do not obscure the screen. \n\n*** You do not need to keep your fingers on them ***\n\nSliding your finger anywhere on the right screen half affects the right control stick , the same for the left screen part  - sliding finger there moves the left control stick.\n \nWe suggest selecting beginner settings at first few days before you can comfortably progress further.",

    "description": "This app offers four different calculations and shows the results both in a pane and on a psychrometric diagram:\n1. Air treatment\n   Calculates how to convert a given ambient air to a required design air. The steps involved are cooling with a given sensible heat factor, dehumidifying, heating and humidifying (adiabatic or steam). Depending on the given and required air conditions, some of these steps may not be needed.\n\n2. Capacities\n   Calculates the required capacity to cool down or heat up a given amount of air (e.g. air in your room).\n\n3. Heat exchanger\n   Calculates how warm room air heats up cool ambient air before supplying it as fresh air to the room. While heating up the ambient air, the heat exchanger cools down the room air, which may result in condensate. When the ambient air would be too cold, this calculation dimensions an electric heater to prevent condensate.\n\n4. Carburetor icing\n   Given a temperature and a dew point temperature, calculates the probability of icing in an airplane carburetor. Graphically shows the danger zones on a diagram.\n\nThese four calculations show the results in a pane, but also graphically in a diagram. You can choose between three different diagrams:\n1. Psychrometric\n   This is the classic diagram representing different kinds of air properties into a single diagram. You find detailed descriptions in standard books about air treatment, such as ASHRAE. This diagram shows lines of constant temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy and specific volume.\n\n2. Mollier\n   This is probably the oldest diagram to represent air properties and named after its inventor Richard Mollier (1863-1935). To get a psychrometrics diagram from a Mollier diagram, swap it along the vertical axis and rotate it 90°.\n   The Mollier diagram is heavily used in Eastern Europe and Germany and shows the same lines as in the psychrometrics diagram.\n\n3. Dewpoint\n   This diagram is meant for meteorologists and pilots. It is easy to read important weather data, such as temperature, dew point and relative humidity. However, this diagram shows the same constant lines as for the other two. Interestingly, the straight lines in the other two diagrams become curved lines in this one and vice versa.\n\nAlthough the app runs on several iOS devices, it gives its best result on a larger iPad screen. On smaller screens you may need to zoom in (see below).\n\nFeatures\n- Select two air properties to define a point: dry bulb temperature, wet bulb temperature, humidity ratio, relative humidity, enthalpy, specific volume and moist air density.\n- No need for a keyboard. Enter data using buttons for small and large value increments.\n- Choose between metric or imperial unit dimensions, e.g. °C and °F or kW and BTU/h.\n- See immediate results of any change on the diagrams and the result panel shows detailed information about a point on the diagram.\n- Choose one of the diagram types (Psychrometrics, Mollier or Dewpoint) for the graphical results. Hide some constant lines on the selected diagram to simplify it. Define colors for the diagram lines and the background gradient.\n- Define the efficiency properties of a heat exchanger, giving you professional results.\n- Tap the explain tab to get a short explanation of a calculation or a diagram.\n- Zoom in (two fingers gesture) and pan (one finger gesture) to enlarge and move a part of the diagram.\n- The app saves your latest settings and starts up with those settings. Adapts its user interface when you rotate your screen.\n- Detects the language settings on the iOS devices and, if possible, changes its language (French, German, Spanish and Dutch). Otherwise keeps using English.",

The work is dated to sometime between the 3rd century BC and the 1st century BC.\n\nA couplet or Kural consists of seven cirs, with four cirs on the first line and three on the second. A cir is a single or a combination of more than one Tamil word. Situational Thirukkurals is our attempt to present a curated portion of these for application in today's world.\n\nThe App has 4 main categories : Work, Relationships, Growing old and Soul, and several sub-categories. Carefully selected Kurals with English translations are available in each category. The App goes on to suggest situations in modern life where these can come most useful. \n\nEach page is presented in the following format:\nTitle\nTranslation\nKural in Tamil\nKural in English\nApplicable situations\n\nUse the app to share the wisdom with the world in the format of a digital card. \n\nThe app is designed to work well on both the iPhone and iPad.",

    "description": "Artista Impresso has been chosen as the official app of the Macy’s® Art in Bloom Flower Show—A Springtime Celebration of Imagination and Creativity! \n\n\nTransform your snapshot into a stroke-filled Impressionist masterpiece\n\nArtista Impresso — Passion Filled Impressionism\n\nThe 19th century brush-wielding Impressionist artists were crazy about flowers and gardens, and it was good. With flowing brush strokes and thickly painted texture, Van Gogh made his sunflowers immortal; with harmonious movement of color, contrast, and form, Monet made his lily pond a celebrity. It took their genius, lifetimes of practice, and navigating the riot of their senses, but these extraordinary artists took what they saw and felt in the petals and leaves and transferred their impressions onto canvasses full of beauty, mood, and meaning. \n\nLucky you, 21st century iPhone-wielding seer and lover of beauty—you have Impresso. With the same enduring attention to detail, light, color, and texure, Impresso transforms your photos into multi-textured, stroke-filled Impressionist masterpieces. And keen eyes will love how Impresso maintains the balance of your piece! The result—captivating, print-worthy paintings brimming with passion, life, and beauty. \n\nIMPRESSIONISM STYLES\nAlla Prima—uses a small brush inside an already placed detail ellipse tool for up-close or full-length portraits and still lifes. Included with this beautiful paint style is a library of artistic finishes to fill the painting with light and color\n\nEn Plein Air—creates a stroke-filled landscape using one of the eight color palettes created by famous impressionist artists.\n\n\nFEATURES \nOne-touch settings automatically transform photos into paintings using one of many paint styles.\n\nOne-of-a-kind ellipse detail tool renders small brush strokes inside the placed area. A single ellipse can be used for a face or body; or use two or more for the eyes, hands or other objects.\n\nCanvas or Linen texturing—gives realism to brushed paint. Control over texture turns strength down for printing to canvas.\n\nArtista Impresso is a professional painting app created for photographers and artists of all skill levels!\n\n\nINCLUDES\n• Three easy to change brush stroke styles\n• Control over detail ellipse tool, canvas strength, artistic finish and painted edge\n• Canvas and linen texture\n• 8 Impressionist palette styles\n• 40 One-touch paint styles\n• 70 Artistic finishes\n\n\nEVERY JIXIPIX PRODUCT FEATURES\n•\tSupport for high resolution images and output\n•\tMultiple Undo\n•\tRandomize Button\n•\tQuick Previewing\n•\tCustomizable Styles\n•\tSuperior customer service\nContact us any time we are committed to your long-term satisfaction!\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nJixiPix turns any photo into a masterpiece. \nThe only requirement is art appreciation—we will take care of the rest!\n________________________________________________________\n\nJixiPix.Com\nCreative Tools for Creative Types\nPhotography | Graphic | Artistic Apps",

Indeed, some of our Miracle puzzles have as few as two givens digits (!) but you will find them all to be solvable with a bit of clever logic! At launch you will be able to play through 4 variants all of which make use of a non-consecutive restraint (ie neighboring cells cannot have two consecutive numbers in them). They are Non-Consecutive Sudoku, classic Miracle Sudoku (non-consecutive + knight + king restrictions), Non-Consecutive Thermo Sudoku and Non-Consecutive Sandwich Sudoku. Each of these variants has a unique feel which refreshes the logic you may be used to, especially in thermo and sandwich sudoku!\n\nAs with our other games (‘Classic Sudoku’, ‘Sandwich Sudoku’, ‘Chess Sudoku’ and 'Thermo Sudoku'), Simon Anthony and Mark Goodliffe (the hosts of Cracking The Cryptic) have written all the hints for the puzzles. So you know that every puzzle has been play-tested by a human being to ensure that each sudoku is interesting and fun to solve.\n\nIn Cracking The Cryptic’s games, players start with zero stars and earn stars by solving puzzles. The more puzzles you solve, the more stars you earn and the more puzzles you get to play. Only the most dedicated (and cleverest) sudoku players will finish all the puzzles. Of course the difficulty is carefully calibrated to ensure lots of puzzles at every level (from easy through to extreme). Anyone familiar with their YouTube channel will know that Simon and Mark take pride in teaching viewers to be better solvers and, in these games, they always craft the puzzles with the mindset of trying to help solvers improve their skills.\n\nMark and Simon have both represented the UK many times at the World Sudoku Championship and you can find more of their puzzles (and lots of others) on the internet’s biggest sudoku channel Cracking The Cryptic.\n\nFeatures:\n40 beautiful puzzles on launch\n4 different variants with more hybrid variants coming post launch\n100 puzzles in all with regular updates to reach this total in the first year post launch.\nHints crafted by Simon and Mark!",

    "description": "It is very important to know the disease of your crops since the very beginning. Discover your plant disease using a photo of your plant leaf. Leaves are the most commonly observed part for detecting an infection.\nTake note that symptoms in some plants can appear slowly, so usually it is difficult for farmers to notice and correctly diagnose the plant disease.\n\n+ This app could diagnose the disease of the following diseases:\nApple scab, Cedar apple rust, Black rot, Powdery mildew, Cercospora leaf spot, Gray leaf spot, Common rust, Northern leaf blight, Eriophyes vitis, Grape esca (Black Measles), Leaf blight (Isariopsis leaf spot), Orange haunglongbing (Citrus greening), Leaf scorch, Early blight, Leaf Mold,\nSeptoria leaf spot, Two-spotted spider mite, Tomato target spot, Mosaic virus, Tomato yellow leaf curl virus, Bacterial spot and Late blight.\n\n+ So you can take a picture of the following plant leaves to detect them:\nTomatoes, Pepper, Apple, Pear, Quince, Grape  vines, Cabbage, Broccoli, Potato, Lemon, Orange, Sweet potato, Cauliflower, Raspberry, Squash, Corn, Peach, Strawberry, Roses, Apricot, Nectarine and Plum.\n\nThe rapid, accurate diagnosis of disease severity will help to reduce yield losses.\n\nAnother Advantages:\n+ You can have more reliable source of food\n+ You can grow more crops. \n+ You can protect them.\n\nThis app allows the opportunity to use computer vision techniques to monitor the disease type and severity and increase yields. \nA huge image database (thousand of images) has been used to get the maximum accuracy using artificial neural networks .\n\nThis app has also an option to report an image that couldn’t be recognised. If that is the case, it is automated that you can report it immediately by email to the author. So it guarantees that the database image will be improved constantly.\n\nThe intended purpose of this app is help the farmers to build a better and bigger crops, which results in a more sustainable world.\n\nDiseases are a major thread to losses of modern agricultural production. Keep your crops healthy.\nFor any doubt, please contact me at bellostudios@gmail.com.",

If you experience issues, a device restart is required.\n\nHow to use:\n- tap on the before/after image slots to load the images from the Library (or take a new one with the camera). You can load both before/after images at the same time (if both slots are open).  Optionally, you can load a logo (for best results, use a png image with transparency) that will be shown in one of the corners when you are in Slideshow mode\n- modify the slide handle/slideshow settings to match your needs\n- once both images are loaded, tap on the Compare button and drag the slider with your finger\n- to create Slideshow, the before and after images for the current slide must be present (valid only for the first slide). Once the images are loaded and you altered to settings to match your preferenes, tap on the Slideshow button and watch it run automatically. To add a new slide, tap on the Add Slide button at the bottom of the screen and then add images to it. You can edit the slides order by going into the Edit mode (top left button)\n- to add background music to the Slideshow, from the side menu, tap the Pick Song button and load a song from your device's library. Next time you press the Slideshow button, the song will play.\n- to hide the top and bottom control bars in 2 Image Compare/Slideshow mode, tap on the eye icon in the top right corner. To show them again, double tap or long press on the device's screen\n- To record, activate the Rec button and then press the Slideshow button. The recording will stop once the slideshow is finished, and you will be presented with the resulting video. From there you will be able to trim it before saving/sharing it.\n- To export a slideshow recording to GIF, then press the GIF button in the top right corner, load the slideshow video, trim it (20 seconds maximum), then press EXPORT GIF button and then save/share it.\n\nThe app is suitable for those who want to compare the before and after images (to see weight loss or diet/fitness program results, makeup or aesthetic transformation etc) or to impress their friends/bosses/clients with the work they've done, by presenting them the stages of their work in a cool way. \n\nIf you're having trouble loading images, try turning on the User Regular Image Picker switch in the side menu settings.\n\nEnjoy this app and don't forget to contact us through the app's contact form if you have something to say!",

    "description": "The best camera is the one you have with you. But what if that camera was improved with pro features, a gorgeous interface, intuitive controls, and was always with you?\n\nThat camera is Obscura.\n\n\nCamera\n————————————————\nObscura is designed to make it fast and easy to capture stunning images. Whether you're shooting in portrait or landscape, the Control Wheel fits into your hand perfectly. You won't be fumbling around trying to capture a photo when you're in a hurry – everything is accessible with one thumb. Finely tuned haptic feedback gives the devices a sense of physicality, so you can feel every adjustment.\n\nFormat\n————\nYou can shoot in a wide range of formats:\n\n• RAW - capture more details and allow for a greater amount of flexibility when editing.\n\n• HEIC - a new image format that uses advanced compression for high quality files at smaller sizes.\n\n• JPEG - You can never really go wrong with JPEG, can you? It just works everywhere.\n\n• Live Photo - combine high resolution photos with video clips that bring your images to life.\n\n• Depth - allows you to apply exciting portrait mode effects and more.\n\n\nFilters\n————\nObscura includes a bunch of gorgeous filters to add style to your images. \nThere are 19 included filters, perfect for a wide range of scenes.\n\n• A Sepia filter unlocked by sharing the app with friends\n\n• A Black & White filter pack, including 8 filters. Especially good for dealing with low light and striking architecture.\n\n• An Analogue filter pack, including 7 filters. These work great for giving a cinematic look to your images.\n\n\nOther Camera Features\n————\nObscura has all the features you expect in a great camera app, including:\n• Flash control\n• Grids\n• Shutter Timer\n• Spirit Level\n\n\nLibrary\n————————————————\nWith a single swipe you can browse your library. \nBut Obscura doesn’t just have a simple image browser, it’s much more powerful than that.

You can save the filtered image as an adjustment, or as a new copy. \n\n• Share - There’s a good old share sheet, so you can share with your friends, and open images in other apps.\n\n• Copy - quickly copy an image to the clipboard, so you can share it with ease.\n\n• Favourite - Mark an image as favourite. Simple.\n\n• Hide - Not every image is for everyone to see. It’s cool. We get it.\n\n• Delete - Goodbye forever little photo.\n\n• Trash - Obscura has a neat little feature where you can add photos to a special trash album, so you can delete them all in one go. Efficient. \n\n\nSettings\n————————————————\nWith a wide range of customisation options, Obscura works your way. You can change the effects of gestures, secondary capture formats, and even the app icon! \n\n\nPrivacy\n————————————————\nWe believe that your personal information belongs to you. Obscura doesn’t collect any information about you, so there’s nothing to share with third parties, nothing can be hacked or leaked, because we don’t have it.
