    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

You’ll need to use all of your brain cells to find out what’s really going on!\n\nWe’ve applied our own imagination to the story of the world’s greatest inventor, Leonardo da Vinci, providing players with unique special abilities throughout gameplay. We allow you to warp back into your early days as a young apprentice, exploring the 16th century world around you, peeking into Leonardo’s mechanisms, puzzles and devices, as you eventually become powerful enough to control time itself and learn the secrets hidden in the past.\n\nMany challenging puzzles are inspired by Leonardo Da Vinci's real inventions and ideas. Mysterious locations were created based on original artworks and the wonderful Florence, Italy of 1506.\n\n• LIKE THE HOUSE OF DA VINCI ON FACEBOOK • \nhttps://www.facebook.com/thehouseofdavinci\n\n• FEEDBACK AND SUPPORT • \nFor any feedback or support questions please do not hesitate to contact us at davinci@bluebraingames.com\n\n• MORE INFORMATION • \nFind out more about the game on http://www.thehouseofdavinci.com/.\n\n• LANGUAGES• \nThe House of Da Vinci is now available in English, French, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Czech, Slovak, Russian, Turkish, Italian, Polish, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese, Hindi and Malay.\n\n• WHO ARE WE? • \nBlue Brain Games is an enthusiastic indie team of graphic artists and developers, all of whom are fans of both 3D puzzle games and the renaissance genius Leonardo Da Vinci.

Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength. All this data appears on the dash and can be managed with the mode switch, keeping your hands where they belong: on the handlebar.",

These questions are from Y Combinator’s “How to Start a Startup” course at Stanford viewed by thousands of people. \n\nWhat is Y Combinator?\nY Combinator is a startup accelerator based in Mountain View, CA. Forbes has found Y Combinator to be the most commercially successful startup accelerator in the world. Wired has called Y Combinator a \"boot camp for startups\" and \"the most prestigious program for budding digital entrepreneurs.”\n\n**TIPS FROM Y COMBINATOR**\n“Keep a log all the things that seem to be missing and all the problems you encounter in life. Use a platform that allows you to easily add to the log on your phone. You want to be able to pull out your phone and jot something down quickly whenever you notice something missing or problematic. Turn off all of your other filters, including whether the thing that’s missing could be a startup idea. Also don’t worry about whether the problems you encounter are too trivial. The idea is to get this background process running, and get you in the habit of noticing more potential startup ideas.”\n\nFeatures:\n• Fast and easy way to capture ideas \n• Y Combinator questions to refine your ideas\n• Simple, effortless organization\n• Clean, distraction free writing experience\n• Easily export ideas as a file or text\n• Privacy with Touch ID and Passcode lock",

    "description": "The CycleBeads app enables you to plan or prevent pregnancy easily and effectively by simply tracking your period each cycle. Just enter the date your period starts, and the app identifies your fertile and non-fertile days according to the patented Standard Days Method®. \n\nRESEARCH\nThis modern natural family planning method has been researched extensively in medical trials and is the only proven family planning method which allows you to manage your fertility simply by tracking your period. iCycleBeads is the only iPhone app in the world based on this method. It has been found to be 95% effective in perfect use and 88% effective in typical use.*\n\nCRITERIA FOR USE\nThe one medical criterion for using this method effectively is that you should have cycles between 26 and 32 days long**. Most women do, but not all. If you are unsure if your cycle is in this range, the CycleBeads app can be used to track your cycle lengths and will let you know if your cycles are in this range. \n\nYou can also take a self-screener at: www.cyclebeads.com/screen \n\nHOW TO USE\nTo use iCycleBeads, simply input the date your most recent period started. The app immediately lets you know what day of your cycle you are on, whether it is a potentially fertile day or an infertile day, and when your fertile days will occur this cycle, all based on the Standard Days Method. You can use this information to either plan pregnancy, avoid pregnancy, or just to track.  This information is provided in both a calendar format and in a visual representation of Cycle Beads.  \n\nKEY FEATURES:\n•A visual representations of your cycle based on the start date of your period in both calendar and CycleBeads formats\n•Customizable alerts notifying you when you are on your fertile days, when your fertile window is ending, and when you are likely to start your next period \n•Alerts reminding you to input your period start date or when you had a cycle outside the range of 26-32 days long\n•A notes feature which allows you to track key information that you may want to discuss with your health provider\n•Ongoing cycle data history so you can see the start dates of your previous cycles, the length of each cycle, and whether that cycle was in the range for using this method effectively.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\nFor more information on the research behind this family planning method, to watch a video on how it works, or to learn more about this family planning tool, visit www.CycleBeads.com \n\nMillions of women around the world have used this method as birth control, to plan pregnancies, or just to better understand their cycles. A portion of the proceeds from sales of all CycleBeads products including the iCycleBeads app, supports research to expand family planning options around the world, and help people make informed choices about their reproductive health. \n\nWe update iCycleBeads regularly. Please send us any feedback or requests for improvements to info@cyclebeads.com. \n\niCycleBeads is protected under patent. \n\nSources: \n* Arevalo M. et al., Contraception, 2002;65;333-338. \n** According to data from the World Health Organization and analyzed by researchers at Georgetown University, approximately 80% of cycles are in the 26-32 day range.",

Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you.",

    "description": "A unique tool for teaching and learning the top 100 most teachable topics in internal medicine\n\nThere are many challenges for residents when training students who are making the big \"jump\" from preclinical to clinical. Most notably, they need to find time to pick and prepare topics to teach in meaningful ways without the availability of a blackboard in the learning hospital. Students also need to quickly be able to grasp these concepts quickly and with the ability to recall them later. This teaching manual primarily focuses on physiology/pathophysiology/exam findings with the goal of providing content to make teaching and learning on the wards easier for both attendings/senior residents and interns/medical students. It features the 100 most teachable topics (clinical pearls) in an image-based presentation and will cover all the major disciplines of internal medicine, including cardiology, gastroenterology, endocrine, and infectious disease.\n\nEach topic, or card, has an image on one side to prompt discussion (ECG, CXR, physical exam finding, etc.), and the flip side includes teaching points organized in question and answer format. They are presented in a pocket-sized binder with removable cards so both residents and students can remove only the topics of the day or ones they need to study.\n\nFeatures:\n• Each topic area has been reviewed by a specialist at Harvard Medical School.\n• Visual, easy-to-use and reference tool for on-the-go\n• Discusses the \"why\" behind a teachable topic\n• Q&A format serves both rotation and exam prep\n• Case-based to practice clinical pearls and complex topics\n\nThis app is very intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing you to browse the contents or search for topics. The powerful search tool gives you word suggestions that appear in the text as you type, so it is lightning fast and helps with spelling those long medical terms. The search tool also keeps a recent history of past search terms so you can go back to a previous search result very easily. You have the ability to create notes, and bookmark cards as Know or Don't Know to help with studying. There is also a Random tab to quiz yourself on a randomly selected card. You can also change the text size for easier reading.\n\nAfter the app has been downloaded, no internet connection is needed to retrieve the content of the app. All of the text and images are available to you on your device anytime, anywhere, and lightning fast. This app is also automatically optimized for whatever size device you are currently using, either phone or tablet. \n\nCheck out https://usatinemedia.com to learn more and watch a video demo of this app.\n\nThis interactive app contains the full content of Teaching Rounds: A Visual Aid to Teaching Internal Medicine Pearls on the Wards by McGraw-Hill Education.\n\nAuthors:\nNavin Kumar, MD\nClinical Fellow, Medicine\nDivision of Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Endoscopy\nBrigham and Women's Hospital\nResearch Fellow in Medicine\nHarvard Medical School\n\nAnica Law, MD\nClinical Fellow, Medicine\nDivision of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine\nBeth Israel Deaconess and Massachusetts General Hospital\nResearch Fellow in Medicine\nHarvard Medical School\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is intended for the education of healthcare professionals and not as a diagnostic and treatment reference for the general population. \n\n\nDeveloped by Usatine Media \nRichard P.

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

These values can be selected as fixed basic values or saved values from the previous session. To change a value, first tap on the property's field to enable the property. Upon activation, the field lights up in a preset bright color. At the bottom of the screen, a keypad for input of the same color lights up. The keypad can be chosen to be for absolute or for incremental input of values and is adapted to current property. Switching between the different keypads is done with a long tap on a value field.\nIn conjunction with activation of a property, in most cases, some other value fields are also lit in a darker color to indicate that their values will also change.\nWith a quick double tap on a value's field a brief description and a descriptive image of current property can be obtained. The same thing happens when you double tap the result field on page 2, but all results are described in a scrollable image.\n\n\nPage 1 is used for input and calculation of cutting data, surface fineness and cutting time. Page 1 manages itself and is NOT DEPENDENT on page 2.\nPage 2, on the other hand, is dependent on page 1 and is used for further data entry and calculations.\n\n\nTREATED VALUES ON PAGE 1\n\n- Diameter\n- Cutting length\n- Cutting speed\n- Spindle speed\n- Feed per revolution\n- Feed per minute\n- Tip radius\n- Surface\n- Time\n\n\nINPUT VALUES ON PAGE 2\n\n- Processing type\n- Cutting depth\n- Entering angle\n- Specific cutting force (kc)\n   · Material\n   · Rake angle\n- Efficiency\n\n\nRESULTING VALUES ON PAGE 2\n\n- Material removal   (volume and rate)\n- Chip thicknesses   (max and average (equivalent))\n- Cutting forces   (tangential, axial and radial)\n- Torque   (spindle)\n- Power   (spindle and motor)",

However, I miss the beautifully blurred background and bokeh effects that I can get using my DSLR camera. 'Bokeh Lens' for iOS will let you make the subject in your photo stand out by making the background blurred with natural-looking bokeh effects through the easy editing process.\n\nSelecting the foreground area (area to be remaining as sharp) is the key factor to get the best possible result. The selection tool in this app was designed and developed to meet your detail-oriented editing needs. It will display a loupe (magnifying glass) when you zoom-in and try to select/deselect area. The loupe is very handy because otherwise you can't see the spot you're touching as your finger is blocking your view.\n\nYou can also adjust bokeh level (aperture) to control how much your photo's background should be bokeh-blurred.\n\nHere are the reasons why you should get Bokeh Lens today:\n- Great result with bokeh-blurred background\n- Easy to use\n- Awesome selection tool\n- Delightful experience\n\nPlease enjoy the experience and don't hesitate to share your bokelicious photos!  \n\nResult image samples can be found in our Flickr group. Please join our Flickr group:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/bokehliciousapp\n\nand follow us on Twitter:\nhttp://twitter.com/BokehLens\n\nUse hashtag #bokehlens when you share your photos,\n\nand give us your feedback at:\nhttp://bokehlens.uservoice.com",

    "description": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

    "description": "PEPI BATH is a pretend play, self-care game where children learn about hygiene in a fun way. Play together with your kids and help them understand the importance of hygiene while developing daily bathroom routines and healthy habits.\r\n\n\nThe app has 4 different situations in which cute character PEPI – a boy or a girl – appears: at the sink, washing clothes, going to a toilet and taking a bath. \nEvery scene offers nice and simple interactions that will help to develop daily bath routines. Characters have a wide range of animated emotions, to react to player actions, so they will frown if something goes not to their liking. This design choice allowed us to create an app without any spoken language, making it widely accessible for audiences all around the world, regardless of spoken language or age.\r\n\nPEPI BATH can be played both as a set process of cleaning or without any pre-set sequence, thus little players are free to choose what they want to do.\r\nCleanliness is fun, however, after washing PEPI’s hands or brushing teeth, kids can pop soap bubbles or play with colorful sprayers, rubber ducks and other items and toys.  \r\n\nPEPI BATH was created as a premium app to be experienced by parents and kids of ages 2 to 6. As such, this app contains no in-app purchases or third-party advertising.\r\n\nAccolades and testimonials:\r\n• FWA Mobile Of The Day (MOTD) Award - thefwa.com/mobile \r\n• FAMIGO APProved Badge - famigo.com\r\n• Editor's Favourite Badge - appysmarts.com\r\n\n\n„A fantastic ‘tidy-up’, self-care, the app that will make those day-by-day duties real fun, at least on the app. Really easy to use, with cute illustrations and nice sound feedback. Certainly, a keeper“ by apps4kids.net\r\n\n„Amazing for children with disabilities, especially with autism“ by i-sen.cz\r\n\n„PEPI BATH would be a great way to introduce your kid to the concept of toilet training. It is yet another beautifully designed and easy-to-use app for kids“ by lilmagoolie.com",
