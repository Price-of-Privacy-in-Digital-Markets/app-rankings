    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",

    "description": "Hey you! Yeah you! Shouldn't you be looking for Camera+ 2 instead? Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots.",

But what if that camera was improved with pro features, a gorgeous interface, intuitive controls, and was always with you?\n\nThat camera is Obscura.\n\n\nCamera\n————————————————\nObscura is designed to make it fast and easy to capture stunning images. Whether you're shooting in portrait or landscape, the Control Wheel fits into your hand perfectly. You won't be fumbling around trying to capture a photo when you're in a hurry – everything is accessible with one thumb. Finely tuned haptic feedback gives the devices a sense of physicality, so you can feel every adjustment.\n\nFormat\n————\nYou can shoot in a wide range of formats:\n\n• RAW - capture more details and allow for a greater amount of flexibility when editing.\n\n• HEIC - a new image format that uses advanced compression for high quality files at smaller sizes.\n\n• JPEG - You can never really go wrong with JPEG, can you? It just works everywhere.\n\n• Live Photo - combine high resolution photos with video clips that bring your images to life.\n\n• Depth - allows you to apply exciting portrait mode effects and more.\n\n\nFilters\n————\nObscura includes a bunch of gorgeous filters to add style to your images. \nThere are 19 included filters, perfect for a wide range of scenes.\n\n• A Sepia filter unlocked by sharing the app with friends\n\n• A Black & White filter pack, including 8 filters. Especially good for dealing with low light and striking architecture.\n\n• An Analogue filter pack, including 7 filters. These work great for giving a cinematic look to your images.\n\n\nOther Camera Features\n————\nObscura has all the features you expect in a great camera app, including:\n• Flash control\n• Grids\n• Shutter Timer\n• Spirit Level\n\n\nLibrary\n————————————————\nWith a single swipe you can browse your library. \nBut Obscura doesn’t just have a simple image browser, it’s much more powerful than that.

You can save the filtered image as an adjustment, or as a new copy. \n\n• Share - There’s a good old share sheet, so you can share with your friends, and open images in other apps.\n\n• Copy - quickly copy an image to the clipboard, so you can share it with ease.\n\n• Favourite - Mark an image as favourite. Simple.\n\n• Hide - Not every image is for everyone to see. It’s cool. We get it.\n\n• Delete - Goodbye forever little photo.\n\n• Trash - Obscura has a neat little feature where you can add photos to a special trash album, so you can delete them all in one go. Efficient. \n\n\nSettings\n————————————————\nWith a wide range of customisation options, Obscura works your way. You can change the effects of gestures, secondary capture formats, and even the app icon! \n\n\nPrivacy\n————————————————\nWe believe that your personal information belongs to you. Obscura doesn’t collect any information about you, so there’s nothing to share with third parties, nothing can be hacked or leaked, because we don’t have it. We think that’s best for everyone. \n\nThe only data we see is the opt-in analytics that’s automatically collected by iOS. See more about it at apple.com/privacy\n\n\nExtras\n————————————————\nObscura has a Notification Center widget, which makes it quick and easy to access the app from the lock screen.\n\nPress firmly on the app icon on your home screen to quickly jump to some of Obscura’s features.\n\n\nRequirements\n————————————————\nNot all features are available on every device :( \n\nFocus Peaking - requires iPhone 6 or newer\nRAW capture - requires iPhone 6S or newer\nHEIC capture - requires iPhone 7 or newer\nDepth Capture - requires Dual Camera (iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X)\nAdvanced Haptic Feedback - requires iPhone 7 or newer\n\n\n————————————————\n\n\nMade by Ben Rice McCarthy\nhttp://www.benricemccarthy.com/\n\nMore info at\nhttp://obscura.camera",

    "description": "-- INTRODUCING MULTI-CAM MODE --\n\nMulti-Cam Mode is a one-time in-app purchase that unlocks these fantastic features:\n• Control up to 12 Blackmagic cameras at once\n• Create up to 3 distinct Control Groups, to give you fine-grain control over different settings for different cameras\n• You can choose to have changes made on one camera automatically update all the other cameras in its Control Group, or control everything straight from Bluetooth+\n• Give your cameras Nicknames to quick, easy control \n\nMulti-Cam gives you control over the following features synced across an entire Group:\n• Start/Stop Recording\n• White Balance + Tint\n• Project frame rate (off-speed frame rates not supported)\n• Shutter Angle/Speed\n• ISO\n• Overlays\n• Slate\n• Trigger Auto-focus\n\nYou can still control all other settings on a camera-by-camera basis, including:\n• Trigger stills capture\n• Iris control \n• Focus + Zoom (on supported lenses)\n• Codec + Resolution\n• Playback control\n• You can also set ISO specifically, rather than by camera group\n\n\nAnd of course, everyone has access to all of these amazing features:\n\nUsing the built-in Bluetooth in your camera, Bluetooth+ gives you the ability to wirelessly control the following functions:\n• Follow Focus (limited support for EF Mount cameras). See below for more info\n• Zoom Control on supported lenses\n• Trigger Stills capture\n• Record Start/Stop\n• White Balance + Tint, including 5 helpful presets and Auto White Balance\n• Audio Controls\n• Trigger Autofocus (for supported electronic lenses with autofocus enabled on lens)\n• Off-speed frame rates\n• Aperture (for supported electronic lenses)\n• Shutter Angle\n• ISO\n• Auto-Exposure Control\n• Active Card\n• Power On/Off\n• Monitor Overlays\n• Codec & Resolution\n• Enter metadata in the Digital Slate (including location data from your iPhone or iPad if you give permission)\n• Control Lock - locks critical controls while recording, preventing accidental settings changes during takes\n\n\n-- Follow Focus --\nYou can now pull focus wirelessly right from your iPhone or iPad. There are some limitations outlined below.\n• Currently only fully supports Pocket 4K, but as of v1.4 we now have limited support for EF mount cameras - Pocket 6K, Ursa Mini Pro G1 & G2\n• The camera does not supply the app with any information on the lenses current focus distance, so the app will not update in real time if you pull focus manually on the lens\n• Due to the nature of bluetooth, focus pulls may not be 100% smooth. It works well for nice slow pulls, but fast pulls my not feel entirely natural and organic. Unfortunately this is a limitation of the available technology.\n• On EF mount cameras, we can only offset focus from its current position, with no broader knowledge of where the lens is in its focus range. This means that focus marks are not possible. In addition, focus pulls on EF mount cameras can be quite jerky depending on the lens in use.\n\n\n-- Playback Control --\nWith Bluetooth+ you can control the playback of clips right from your iOS device. There are some notable limitations at this point. Currently you can:\n• Start playing a clip, either forwards or backwards\n• Navigate between clips, either forwards or backwards\n\nFor now, you will not be able to:\n• Pause a clip that is already playing\n• Change the speed of a clip that is already playing\n• Control clip looping\n\n\n-- Zoom Control --\nControl the zoom level on supported lenses. For the most part, this will only work on MFT lenses with electronic zoom. We are currently unaware of EF lenses that support this feature\n\n\n-- Slate-Only Mode --\nAs the name suggests, this feature locks the app into Slate-Only mode, without the ability to change critical camera settings or start/stop recording. This means you can let an assistant keep metadata up to date without the fear of interfering with important camera settings.",

Helios helps you improve your photos by notifying you of four magical times of the day.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe golden hour is the period of daytime shortly after sunrise or before sunset, during which daylight is redder and softer than when the Sun is higher in the sky. The opposite period during twilight is the blue hour, just before sunrise or after sunset, when indirect sunlight is evenly diffused. Photography during magic hours is proven to result in better photos than pictures taken at any other time of the day. The app is available around the globe and works without internet connection. It's an essential tool for all photographers and videographers.\n\nDESIGN\nHelios features a beautiful design that follows iOS 12 design language with incredible precision, making the experience truly breathtaking. An elegant dark theme is also available.\n\nFEATURES\nWith advanced tools like augmented reality lens and built-in light meter, planning your photos has never been easier. Powerful calendar and map tool can predict magic hour times, as well as sun and moon positions with extreme accuracy for days, weeks or even months in advance. By saving other locations, you can make sure you'll be prepared to capture the world around you wherever life takes you. Daily notifications help you stay up to date with slightest changes in time and duration of sunset, sunrise and magic hours.\n\n\nFeatured by Apple on the App Store Today page.

    "description": "A young Lion awakens.  He is the last known member of the legendary Zima Clan.  All other members were wiped out in the great catastrophic event.  You must help him navigate the wild safari landscape as he looks to rebuild.  Cross over crocodile infested rivers, flight against cheetahs, hyenas, Elephants, Leopards, and other dangerous animals in this high action adventure simulator.  This is not a typical animal simulator though . . . \n\nIn Clan of Lions, you enter into a world of adventure and magic as you build your group and dominate your enemies.   The magic elements make this game very unique and we believe, best in class.  Find your friends,  rebuild your lioness clan, defeat all the enemies, climb to the top of the food chain, and win the game.  Help Zima regain its dominance.  The game is part adventure and part animal simulation. This adventure simulator will take you on an ultimate epic journey as you build your warrior clan, use your magic, construct your home, defend against enemies that attack, and ultimately defeat all the Super Bosses.  Performance Note : This game will perform best on powerful devices.  The 3D graphics are processor intensive.\n\nBest Game Features:\n-- Build your own Lion Clan\n-- Crocodile, Leopard, Hyena, Cheetah, Elephant, and Snake enemies\n-- Massive 3D Open World Safari Map\n-- Dynamic weather including thunderstorms storms and wind\n-- Ever changing time of day\n-- 4 Magic Spells to unlock - Fireball, Invincibility, Lightning Bolt, and Healing\n-- Map includes Caves, Mountains, and Rivers\n-- 6 Giant bosses \n-- 4 Enemy Clans to defeat\n-- 6 Super Giant Ultra Bosses\n\nTips:  Use the mini map to help you in the game.  It shows the locations of clan members, bosses, magic books, and enemies.  Use the mini map to find the members - \"m\", Bosses \"B\" and Books \"b\". Seek advice from your spirit guide - a ghostlike figure found near your home.   As you defeat the bosses, more bosses will appear.\n\nFind all the magic books to unlock the magical skills including: Healing Potion, Fireball, Lightning Bolt, and Invincibility.  Earn adventure points by hunting and completing tasks.  Use the points to upgrade your strength, stamina, and magic.  \n\nAs you race across the huge Safari open 3D world, you may call the members when you need help against the enemies. Bosses include Snakes, Lion, Bear, Crocodile, Wolf, Attack eagles, and Foxes.  Upgrade your powers to become more powerful, have stronger defense, and have stronger magical ability. This is ultimate animal simulation like you have never seen it.  \n\nIf you like this app, be sure and check out our other 3D animal simulators. We understand that the game is by no means perfect and we welcome your constructive criticism.   Please email your suggestions.  \n\nEvolved is a new series of games we are creating at Wild Foot.  We'd really like to hear from you.  So far the response has been good, so we will continue making apps of this style.

You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Sony TV.\n\nThis works on any Sony Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. \n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Sony TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Sony TV app. It will start looking for your Sony TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Sony TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Sony TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating!

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year. \n  \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves or a White Balance picker. The Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows or sharpen your photo, among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. Use our built-in RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and keep using the tools you are already familiar with.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nEVERYTHING INCLUDED - no IAPs\nCamera+ 2 works great on iPhone and iPad. Use the same tools consistently across all your devices, and take advantage of multitasking in iPad. All features are included in your purchase for all platforms - no in-app purchases required.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.\n\nLIGHTBOX\nPhotos taken with Camera+ 2 go to the Lightbox by default. Filter them easily to focus on the ones you want to work on, and use the built-in editors to create the exact look you are aiming for. Save or share the final versions when you are done.",

If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.",

    "description": "Recommended and shared by thousands of users! Mentioned as the iOS app to use in:\n  ◆  wired.com - How to Sweep For Bugs and Hidden Cameras\nNote that the app is just a helper tool to induce lens reflection and should be used with common sense and manual inspection of the target object.\n \nProtect your privacy from spy hidden camera lenses. Here are some actual news headlines:\n  ◆  Brits staying in Airbnb flat 'find spy camera hidden pointed at bed'\n  ◆  Oil rig worker files lawsuit: I was secretly recorded\n  ◆  Motel manager accused of setting up hidden camera\n  ◆  Models find hidden cameras in apartment\n\nA free do-it-yourself way of detecting cameras from instructables.com, also based on detecting lens reflections:\n  ◆  Step 1: Find a tube that's good for looking through. A cardboard tube from a roll of toilet paper or paper towels is best.\n  ◆  Step 2: All you need is a flashlight or something that you can use to focus a beam of light in a dark room. Attaching a couple of directional LEDs to the outside of the cardboard tube can work also if you don't have a flashlight.\n  ◆  Step 3: With one hand, hold up the toilet paper tube to your eye. With your other hand, hold up the flashlight at about eye level and point it away from you. With one eye, look through the tube and scan the room. If there are any small points of light bouncing back, inspect it further. It might be a camera.\n\nThis app is a tool to help you detect disguised camera lens that you suspect are present in a room. The manual mode with overlay is already equivalent to the do-it-yourself described above or the more expensive hardware camera detector gadgets that tries to detect using the tell-tale signs of tiny reflections of hidden camera lenses. The good thing is this app is always with you, ready when you need it.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS for the APP: \n\nUse this tool after your own visual inspection and investigation. Scan the room first without your phone and once you find something suspicious point the phone camera to the suspected object. The app alternately turns on and off the camera flash to detect the signature of a camera lens. Carefully adjusting the distance and angle relative to the target object helps as well adjusting the level of lighting in the room.\n\nWhen automatic mode is ineffective or distracting you should use manual mode. In both manual and automatic modes you must use your own judgment as this is just a tool like what you would do with an expensive hidden camera detector gadgets or the do-it-yourself detector described above.\n\nMANUAL Detection: \nAnytime that you see the signature of a camera lens you can single-tap on the screen and put a marker on the suspected camera lens.\nYellow overlay - this signifies that the surface might be metallic or glass-like and that a great amount of reflectivity is being detected.\nCyan overlay - this means that the surface is changing in color consistent with the general hue of camera lenses.\n\nAUTOMATIC Detection: \nThe app will continuously try its best to put a marker where it assesses a camera lens may be present. To exclude surfaces that are generating lots of false positives you can zoom the camera or carefully change the distance or angle of the phone to the target. Works best when room lights are dimmed and the phone is very steady.\n\nBONUS 1: EMF scanner to detect the slight magnetic field present in electronic devices including hidden spy cameras. \nBONUS 2: Some home cameras broadcast bluetooth information and this app has a scanner for bluetooth devices.\n\nBE SAFE and START SCANNING!",

You can choose the starting time of the day, that will change dynamically.\r\n\r\nStart the engine, press down on the gas and chase as quickly as possible. Earn points by overtaking traffic cars, you need them to open the new vehicles, modes and other features of the game.\r\n\r\nThis racing simulator gives you the ability to choose the style of driving that can be tranquil and safe or extremely racing. The abundance of settings allows you to customize a level of car physics realism, from arcade and simple to the most realistic, as in the difficult racing simulator in which you will need to show your driving skills.\r\n\r\nRecord your gameplay videos and share them to your friends in social networks with Everyplay Service. You can edit recorded video replays and comment them using the camera and microphone on your device.\r\n\r\nFeatures:\r\n- Modern beautiful graphics;\r\n- Realistic car physics;\r\n- Change the time of day in real-time;\r\n- Qualitatively modeled German cars;\r\n- 4 tracks with different weather conditions;\r\n- First person view / interior camera.\r\n\r\nWarning!

Enjoy virtual driving in heavy car traffic, but please observe the traffic rules and be careful on real roads.",
