It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.\n\nFor Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR. Shoot in RAW (even in BURST), split focus / exposure, and manually control everything (exposure, iso, shutter speed, white balance and focus).\n\nFor Everyone Else - inspired by the pro’s we made the interface simple, fast, and easy to use. We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you. If you have any features, ideas, or feedback please email us at hello@shopmoment.com or DM us on Instagram @moment.\n\n## Premium Features\n+ NEW Timelapse mode - capture stunning time-lapse videos.\n+ Slow Shutter mode - long exposure shots with motion blur and light trails.\n\n## Photography Features\n+ Focus peaking - the green edges will help you dial in your focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ RAW and TIFF - Shoot photos in RAW format for better editing, or TIFF for high-quality printing.\n+ Split Focus and Exposure - Take control of tricky lighting scenarios.\n+ Full Manual - Control shutter speed, iso, exposure, focus, and white balance with easy to use sliders and double taps to reset.\n+ Burst mode - Capture burst shots in RAW format. This is big as now you can capture action with burst but at the uncompressed quality pros want with RAW.\n+ HEIF and HEVC - Seamless support for the latest Apple file formats across photos and videos.\n\n## Filmmaker Features\n+ Focus peaking - the yellow edge glow will help you find dial in the focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ Color Profiles - Select from default, flat, or log color profiles to get the most out of your files in post-processing.\n+ Video Bitrates - Get precise control over video quality with standard, medium, and high bitrates to choose from.\n+ RGB Histogram: Dial in your video color, balance, and exposure with a live RGB histogram.\n+ Waveform monitor - Evaluate video brightness and exposure across your image in real time.\n+ Audio meters - Get just the right sound levels with real-time, precise, dual-channel (when available) audio levels.\n+ Live Histogram - Get your exposure right every time.\n+ Video Stabilization - Make your videos buttery smooth.\n+ Precise Video - Change your resolution and frame rate on screen, without digging into a settings menu.\n+ Anamorphic - Use the Moment Anamorphic lens to shoot amazing, letterbox style photos and videos.\n\n## Works With\n+ Triple/Dual Lens Control - Manually control which side of the triple/dual lens you want to shoot with so you can use Moment lenses over either one.\n+ Moment Lens - select which lens you are shooting with.\n+ Moment Battery Case - Works with the DSLR-like shutter button on our photography cases for half-press and full-press capture. Take better photos, faster.\n+ Apple Watch - Use your watch as a remote to shoot photos or record videos.\n+ Siri Shortcuts - Quick access to capture a photo or start a video\n\nRAW and 3D shutter require an iPhone 6S or later (6S, 7, 8, X, XS, XR, SE)",

Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength. All this data appears on the dash and can be managed with the mode switch, keeping your hands where they belong: on the handlebar.",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year. \n  \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves or a White Balance picker. The Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows or sharpen your photo, among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. Use our built-in RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and keep using the tools you are already familiar with.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nEVERYTHING INCLUDED - no IAPs\nCamera+ 2 works great on iPhone and iPad. Use the same tools consistently across all your devices, and take advantage of multitasking in iPad. All features are included in your purchase for all platforms - no in-app purchases required.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.\n\nLIGHTBOX\nPhotos taken with Camera+ 2 go to the Lightbox by default. Filter them easily to focus on the ones you want to work on, and use the built-in editors to create the exact look you are aiming for. Save or share the final versions when you are done.",

    "description": "Featured in LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\nDa Vinci Eye is the #1 essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

    "description": "Sit on the throne as a benevolent (or malevolent) medieval monarch of the modern age and swipe your royal fingers either left or right to impose your will upon the kingdom. Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.\n\n*iPhone 5 / iPod Touch 6 / iPad Mini / iPad Air or later recommended.",

    "description": "-- INTRODUCING MULTI-CAM MODE --\n\nMulti-Cam Mode is a one-time in-app purchase that unlocks these fantastic features:\n• Control up to 12 Blackmagic cameras at once\n• Create up to 3 distinct Control Groups, to give you fine-grain control over different settings for different cameras\n• You can choose to have changes made on one camera automatically update all the other cameras in its Control Group, or control everything straight from Bluetooth+\n• Give your cameras Nicknames to quick, easy control \n\nMulti-Cam gives you control over the following features synced across an entire Group:\n• Start/Stop Recording\n• White Balance + Tint\n• Project frame rate (off-speed frame rates not supported)\n• Shutter Angle/Speed\n• ISO\n• Overlays\n• Slate\n• Trigger Auto-focus\n\nYou can still control all other settings on a camera-by-camera basis, including:\n• Trigger stills capture\n• Iris control \n• Focus + Zoom (on supported lenses)\n• Codec + Resolution\n• Playback control\n• You can also set ISO specifically, rather than by camera group\n\n\nAnd of course, everyone has access to all of these amazing features:\n\nUsing the built-in Bluetooth in your camera, Bluetooth+ gives you the ability to wirelessly control the following functions:\n• Follow Focus (limited support for EF Mount cameras). See below for more info\n• Zoom Control on supported lenses\n• Trigger Stills capture\n• Record Start/Stop\n• White Balance + Tint, including 5 helpful presets and Auto White Balance\n• Audio Controls\n• Trigger Autofocus (for supported electronic lenses with autofocus enabled on lens)\n• Off-speed frame rates\n• Aperture (for supported electronic lenses)\n• Shutter Angle\n• ISO\n• Auto-Exposure Control\n• Active Card\n• Power On/Off\n• Monitor Overlays\n• Codec & Resolution\n• Enter metadata in the Digital Slate (including location data from your iPhone or iPad if you give permission)\n• Control Lock - locks critical controls while recording, preventing accidental settings changes during takes\n\n\n-- Follow Focus --\nYou can now pull focus wirelessly right from your iPhone or iPad. There are some limitations outlined below.\n• Currently only fully supports Pocket 4K, but as of v1.4 we now have limited support for EF mount cameras - Pocket 6K, Ursa Mini Pro G1 & G2\n• The camera does not supply the app with any information on the lenses current focus distance, so the app will not update in real time if you pull focus manually on the lens\n• Due to the nature of bluetooth, focus pulls may not be 100% smooth. It works well for nice slow pulls, but fast pulls my not feel entirely natural and organic. Unfortunately this is a limitation of the available technology.\n• On EF mount cameras, we can only offset focus from its current position, with no broader knowledge of where the lens is in its focus range. This means that focus marks are not possible. In addition, focus pulls on EF mount cameras can be quite jerky depending on the lens in use.\n\n\n-- Playback Control --\nWith Bluetooth+ you can control the playback of clips right from your iOS device. There are some notable limitations at this point. Currently you can:\n• Start playing a clip, either forwards or backwards\n• Navigate between clips, either forwards or backwards\n\nFor now, you will not be able to:\n• Pause a clip that is already playing\n• Change the speed of a clip that is already playing\n• Control clip looping\n\n\n-- Zoom Control --\nControl the zoom level on supported lenses. For the most part, this will only work on MFT lenses with electronic zoom. We are currently unaware of EF lenses that support this feature\n\n\n-- Slate-Only Mode --\nAs the name suggests, this feature locks the app into Slate-Only mode, without the ability to change critical camera settings or start/stop recording. This means you can let an assistant keep metadata up to date without the fear of interfering with important camera settings.",

    "description": "IMPORTANT: DO NOT buy FieldMonitor without reading this ENTIRE description.\n\nSome cameras have VERY LIMITED capabilities in remote mode: test your camera with its native Wi-Fi app and make sure your workflow and recording formats are supported, and that image quality and lag are acceptable, BEFORE buying FieldMonitor. Email me if you have any questions!\n\n• FieldMonitor has the same latency, resolution, and reliability as the native app.\n\n• If a camera control or feature does not work with the native app, it won’t work with FieldMonitor. \n\n• FieldMonitor has no playback, review or download capability, only shooting controls.\n\n• Wi-Fi monitoring needs a clear Wi-Fi channel. In areas with many busy Wi-Fi networks and/or sources of radio interference, performance cannot be guaranteed. Test for acceptable performance with your camera’s native app BEFORE buying FieldMonitor.\n\nSee https://www.adamwilt.com/fieldmonitor/ for more details.\n\nWHAT IT DOES:\n\nFieldMonitor™ lets you monitor picture, exposure, and color on supported Canon™, Panasonic™, and Sony™ cameras, and Teradek™ H.264 transmitters. FieldMonitor runs on iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch.\n\nUse markers to show safe areas, aspect ratios, and framing grids. Desqueeze anamorphic images, cropped to your final aspect ratio. Flip the image on either axis. Focus Assist helps you nail focus (camera sources only). Use a waveform monitor, vectorscope, histogram, and/or false color. Add 3D LUTs (camera sources only).\n\nWith iPhone 5S or later, iPod touch 6G or later, iPad Air or later, iPad mini 2 or later, or iPad Pro, you can see a false-color picture with adjustable levels.\n\nWith a supported camera and lens you can start/stop recording, control exposure and color settings, and zoom or focus remotely. Controls are designed for fast, realtime adjustments.\n\nLIMITATIONS:\n\n• FieldMonitor does not work with cine cameras or camcorders, only “hybrid” still & video cameras (mirrorless or DSLR).\n\n• Audio is not transmitted from cameras, only Teradeks.\n\n• Camera Wi-Fi images are 512x288, 640x360, 320x180, or 1024x576 depending on the camera. Teradeks support 720p and 1080p.\n\n• Fujifilm: ONLY X-T3 and X-T100 are supported. X-T3 only records 1080p / 29.97 fps; X-T100 only records 720p / 24 fps. See https://www.adamwilt.com/fieldmonitor/support.html#Fujifilm for other limitations.\n\n• “Smart Remote” Sonys do NOT allow use of Picture Profiles (including S-Log) or S&Q Motion when using Wi-Fi remote control. Focus points can only be set in photo mode.\n\n• “Ctrl w/ Smartphone“ Sonys do not display focus area, battery level, and/or storage info. Focus points can’t be set in the app.\n\nSUPPORTED SOURCES:\n\n• Canon: EOS mirrorless and DSLR cameras that support video recording in Wi-Fi remote mode when using Canon’s Camera Connect.\n\n• Fujifilm: only X-T3 (at 1080p/29.97) and XT100 (at 720p/24).\n\n• Panasonic: Lumix cameras that transmit a live view while recording when using Image App or Lumix Sync. GH3 and earlier cameras do NOT support video recording in Wi-Fi remote mode.\n\n• Sony: only Alpha and RX cameras that transmit a live view while recording when using Imaging Edge Mobile. A5000, A6000, A7, A7R, A99 and earlier cameras do NOT support video recording in Wi-Fi remote mode.\n\n• Teradek: Cube (100–600 series), VidiU, and Clip transmitters.

    "description": "Hydra offers innovative photo capture technology, and lets you take beautiful pictures even in the most difficult lighting conditions, which makes it a great companion to iOS Camera app.\n\n“The Hydra app from Belgian company Creaceed is one of the more interesting iOS camera apps we have seen in the recent past.”\n— DPReview\n\n“Hydra is for people who enjoy iPhone photography at a higher and more rewarding level.”\n— David Robinson (iPhonographer)\n\n\"Hydra has the particularity of offering original features, which are missing from many competing apps.\"\n— iPhon.fr\n\nHydra captures more light by merging up to 60 frames to make a single high-quality picture (less noise, more highlights/shadows) on iPhone and iPad. Hydra also goes beyond the 8- or 12-megapixel sensor limit, with up to 32-megapixel high-resolution images. It uses the latest evolutions of iPhone and iPad camera hardware, as well as the latest camera APIs and GPU rendering technologies.\n\nHydra provides 5 specific capture modes: HDR, Video-HDR, Lo-Light, Zoom, and Hi-res modes. \n\n• Hydra's High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is based on an alternate method that captures up to 20 images and that is made to handle even the most difficult lighting conditions. \n• Video-HDR uses single-image tone mapping and device-specific sensor mode to create stunning videos. \n• Lo-Light mode removes sensor noise by merging together multiple images and amplifying light by a factor of 10 to provide a better image quality.\n• Zoom mode uses real-time, super-resolution technique to recreate missing pixels from hand motion, producing 2x, 4x and 8x (telephoto lens) scale factors with more details than the standard digital zooming technique(*).\n• Hi-res mode produces up to 32MP images from the regular 8 or 12MP camera sensor, providing finer details in captured image(*).\n• Hydra supports the telephoto & front cameras respectively in Zoom and Lo-Light/HDR modes to shoot portraits & selfies.\n• Camera support: ultra wide, wide, telephoto, and front facing.\n\nHydra also features a photo gallery for reviewing images and their metadata, directly linked with built-in iOS photo album, thus avoiding duplicates and allowing to flag as favorites.\n\n(*) recommended for static scenes or distant scenery. Rendering artifacts can occur for scenes with parallax and for moving subjects.",

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Sony Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Sony TV.\n\nThis works on any Sony Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. \n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Sony TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Sony TV app. It will start looking for your Sony TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Sony TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Sony TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat. Also their support is brilliant, they responded in less than an hour of the query I emailed to them.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "Your blood oxygen level represents the percentage of oxygen that your red blood cells carry from your lungs to the rest of your body. Knowing how well your blood performs this vital task can help you understand your overall wellness. The majority of people have a blood oxygen level of 95 - 99%. However, some people live a normal life with blood oxygen levels below 95%. \n\nThe Apple Watch can estimate your percentage of oxygen in your bloodstream and stores the data in the Health Store. With the Oxygen Saturation app, you always see your latest value directly on your wrist. This App supports all complications, so make your Apple watch a real Fitness Gadget!!\n\nHow to Use:\n-\tATTENTION: Oxygen Saturation only works if you have an Apple Watch Series 6, because this Apple Watch has the sensor you need to measure your oxygen saturation.\n-\tThe app needs to connect with the Apple’s Health app to display the recorded data on your Apple Watch, as complication or your Iphone.\n-\tUsing iOS 14 you can add a Widget to your home screen on your IPhone to display the latest measurement.\n- In case you are still not receiving any data, please open your Apple Health App and check if it is able to measure your oxygen saturation.",

We've even modeled the distortion that occurs by running a line signal in to the mic inputs.\n\nFeatures\n\n» Accurate analog \"bucket-brigade\" style delay model. Change the delay time, and the signal pitches accordingly.\n\n» Both mic and line inputs modeled, for overdriving the delay section if desired.\n\n» XML-based cross-platform preset manager, with copy and paste.

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

Using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, you will help Taylor make life or death decisions, and face the consequences together.\n\nAcclaimed writer Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) weaves a gripping interactive story through the aftermath of a crash landing on an alien moon. Taylor is stranded, the rest of the crew are dead or missing, and Taylor’s communicator can only reach you. \n\nA totally unique experience enabled by modern devices, this story plays out in real time. As Taylor works to stay alive, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Taylor directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.\n\nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and see what happens when you make a different choice. Simple actions can have a profound effect. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n\nLifeline is a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes. Taylor is relying on YOU.\n\nNEW in version 1.8: Stick around after the game for a special story epilogue from Dave Justus. For players who have already finished the game, the Sneak Peek becomes available under the game options. Enjoy!\n\nInternet connection not required. No in-app purchases and no ads.\n\nWATCH US: http://www.youtube.com/c/LifelineGame\n\nPraise for Lifeline:\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“I felt an immediate attachment to a fictional character pinging me from a strange galaxy to my wearable.” - Luke Hopewell, Gizmodo Australia\n\n“[P]laying it on the Apple Watch makes you truly feel like you’re exchanging messages with an astronaut via a futuristic transmitter.” - Michael Andronico, Tom’s Guide\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character.

    "description": "QUICK SEARCH AND SET OF CONTACTS\nNew utility ICaller from KiraLine Inc is a modern search engine that you can use to very quickly find the person you want and dial his number, irrespective of how large your notebook is. Therefore, this program is particularly useful when driving and when traffic on the road is very slow. Now you just need to type two or three numbers or letters and the utility would display the list of matches, and only need to lightly touch the screen to call the person.\n\nT9 SYSTEM FOR YOUR IPHONE\nYou can search for a contact through the T9 system, which is one of the most popular among mobile phone users around the world. With the T9 system, you type a word, focusing on the keys, each of which has 4-5 letters. Thus, the typing speed increases, while the smart program picks up the word you are looking for.\n\nTWO WORDS IN ONE SEARCH\nWe all come across common names. For example, my phonebook contains 15 people answering Sergeyev, who have different surnames or belong to different aspects of my life. In one of the latest updates, the iCaller developers designed the search system for two words. Use the button \"1\" for additional filtering of contacts.\n\nFAST SMS MESSAGES, AND REMOVAL OF CONTACTS FROM CALL HISTORY\nOur application features maximum functionality at a time and this is of paramount importance to us. You can send SMS from the main screen by swiping your finger over the contact: swiping it in one direction sends SMS, swiping to the other direction deletes a contact from the call history. The same operation is also available from the dial string.\n\nFAVORITE CONTACTS – SELECTED FEATURES\nThe ICaller utility is fully integrated with the phone book, in which you can add and edit contacts, and create a list of up to 50 favorite contacts for speed dialing, adding the photo of a loved one or colleague to the name. You can interchange the position of contact icons, add new ones and instantly dial a number or send an SMS message.\n\nFINE TUNING THE UTILITY FOR YOUR TASTE \nThe program supports advanced options you can use to customize iCaller for yourself. Here, you can enable/disable the sound and tips, and delete call history. In the settings, you can select the priority search by name or surname. This is especially important where two-word search is possible. Screen settings would enable you select the background of the screen, choose the main contact number or display a list to choose from and select the type of image - icons with photos or name of the contact. You can also select the main screen at startup - Favorites or keyboard for searching and dialing a contact.\n\nICALLER SUPPORTS THE MAJOR LANGUAGES OF THE WORLD \nIn the settings, you can choose the primary and secondary language. Note that iCaller supports 5 languages. You can search in Latin and Cyrillic alphabets.\n\nWe welcome your suggestions and feedback at info@kiraline.com.\n\nPlease often go to our official Facebook page for new games and applications!\nwww.facebook.com/kiralineinc",

While the original got rave reviews for its stylized manga graphics and quick, bloody gameplay, Samurai II delivers even more action and an intuitive new control scheme.\n\nSlideToPlay.com - 4/4\nIpadarena.com - 10/10\nAppSpy.com - 5/5\nMacWorld.com - 4.5/5\nAppAdvice.com - 4.5/5\nGamezebo.com - 4.5/5\nTouchreviews.net - 4.5/5\nNineoverten.com - 4.5/5\nifanzine 4.5/5\nGamerstemple.com - 90/100\nPixeljumpers.com - 9/10\nPocketGamer.co.uk 8/10 \n\n\nSamurai: Way of the Warrior was featured in Best Games of 2009 by Apple – Samurai II is a true successor, aided by over a year of focused development. Overall production values and vicious action put Samurai II on par with console 3D brawlers. Screenshots don’t do Samurai II justice – the fluid action has to be seen running at 60 frames per second on the Retina display or popping off the iPad screen.\n\nBut looks alone won’t carry a game – the developers listened to fan feedback and improved gameplay throughout. With a new virtual d-pad, dynamic camera, environmental puzzles, traps, and vicious new enemies, Samurai II is brand new experience for hack ‘n’ slash gamers on the go. \n\nSamurai II sends Daisuke on a quest for revenge across the war-scorched countryside. From a seafaring village to a flying fortress to the legendary Isle of the Dead, the samurai will stop at nothing to hunt down his arch-enemy Orochi. Will he get his Vengeance?\n\nFEATURES:\n* Intuitive virtual joystick ensures you’re slicing up baddies, not swiping the screen.\n\n* Dynamic camera finds the best perspective for each encounter, adding variety while keeping focused on the action.\n\n* Tense, quick and gory battle sequences!\n- Battle hordes of on-screen enemies wielding new weapons and sporting unique abilities.\n- Stay nimble and plan your attacks – roll out of harm’s way and eliminate ranged enemies like the Samurai Archer before they can strike.\n* Improved gameplay includes new features.\n-   Solve environmental puzzles, avoid dangerous traps, and discover useful items.\n- The fight is on - not to worry, the combat never takes a back seat to platforming or fetch-quests.\n\n* RPG elements reward skilled players – upgrade the Samurai’s health, buy new attack combos and upgrade them to devastating levels.\n\n* Between levels, gorgeous anime-style comic panels tell the samurai’s tale with original hand-drawn artwork.\n\n* New survival mode pits the samurai against waves of enemies, giving hardcore players a score-attack mode to hone their skills. Two games in one!\n\n* Advanced AI system on par with console games. Goal Oriented Action Planning architecture is used in many PC and console games.\n\n* Apple Game Center support, including Leaderboards and Achievements. \n\n*Support iCloud to transfer save between various devices\n\n*Support MFI Controllers (Gamepads)\n\n* Original soundtrack – in classic samurai movie style, soft music builds with the heat of battle.\n\nSpecial Thanks To : ImNoSuperMan, PureSkill, Squarezero, Rocco, eggzbacon, Prab",

    "description": "NOTE: Remastered version from the PC version. A device with at least 2 GB of RAM is required for this game to run properly.\n\nWelcome to your new summer job at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza, where kids and parents alike come for entertainment and food as far as the eye can see! The main attraction is Freddy Fazbear, of course; and his two friends. They are animatronic robots, programmed to please the crowds! The robots' behavior has become somewhat unpredictable at night however, and it was much cheaper to hire you as a security guard than to find a repairman.\n\nFrom your small office you must watch the security cameras carefully. You have a very limited amount of electricity that you're allowed to use per night (corporate budget cuts, you know). That means when you run out of power for the night- no more security doors and no more lights! If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n\nCan you survive five nights at Freddy's?\n\n\"For all the simplicity of the game’s controls and premise, Five Nights at Freddy‘s is frightening. It’s a fantastic example of how cleverness in design and subtlety can be used to make an experience terrifying. Simple still images and proper character design steal the show in this game, and show that Scott Cawthon knows quite a lot about the secret fears people feel when looking at creepy dolls and toys. It’s elegant in how it sows fear, and is a must-own for anyone who likes scary games.\" -Joel Couture IndieGameMag.com\n\nNOTE: Game entirely in English.\n\n#MadeWithFusion",

With this we should consign the term “interactive movie” to history’s dustbin, because movies can’t dream of offering audiences a narrative structure as intimate and involving as this: they’re just moving pictures. Her Story points to the future\" 5/5, The Guardian\n\nHer Story is the critically acclaimed mystery game from Sam Barlow. Playing like an interactive true crime documentary, the game lets you go hands on with a police database full of live action video footage. It stars Viva Seifert, actress and one half of the band Joe Gideon and the Shark.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nHer Story sits you in front of a mothballed desktop computer and logs you into a police database. Search through hundreds of video clips that cover seven interviews from 1994 in which a British woman is interviewed about her missing husband. Explore the database by typing search terms, watch the clips where she speaks those words and piece together her story.\n\n\"Her Story is a beautiful amalgam of the cinema and video game formats... a remarkable achievement...\" 90, The Washington Post\n\n\"Profound, gripping live-action drama… sure to be discussed for years to come\" 5/5, Digital Spy\n\nUnlike anything you've played before, Her Story is an involving and moving experience. One that asks you to listen.",

    "description": "OSHO Reminding Yourself of the Forgotten Language of Talking to Your BodyMind.\n\nThis is a guided process allowing you to make friends with your body. A voice will guide you into communicating with your body and with your mind to support natural healing and harmony.\n\nThis process is especially developed as:\n¬ a simple, yet powerful relaxation process for relieving the symptoms of stress-related physical discomforts and pain -- including such as headaches, sleeplessness, digestive problems, neck, and shoulder pain and many other body symptoms.\n\n¬ a method for deepening and harmonizing the body-mind connection, which results in an overall improvement in well-being.\n\n¬ a process of befriending the body and becoming more sensitive to its needs, which in turn can help to support other health-related programs such as diet and exercise.\n\n¬ an initial 7-day process which can be repeated but also used on a daily base according to your own structure.\n\nThe roots of this simple technique can be found in the ancient teachings of China and Tibet. Now, these ancient techniques have been revitalized and updated for the twenty-first century according to the guidance of Osho.\n\nThis guided process is a way of reminding us of a language most of us have forgotten. It's the language of communicating with our own body. To communicate with the body, talking to it, listening to its messages has been a well-known practice in ancient Tibet.\n\nModern medical science is only now beginning to recognize what the sages and mystics have always known: that the mind and body are not separate entities but deeply related. The mind can affect the body, just as the body can affect the mind. Osho has created many meditation techniques especially for today's men and women. This guided meditation of talking to the mind and body has been developed with his guidance.\n\nAbout this, Osho explains: \n\n“Once you start communicating with your body, things become very easy. \n\n“The body need not be forced, it can be persuaded. One need not fight with the body – that's ugly, violent, aggressive, and any sort of conflict is going to create more and more tension. So you need not be in any conflict -- let comfort be the rule. And the body is such a beautiful gift from existence that to fight with it, is to deny existence itself. It is a shrine... we are enshrined in it; it is a temple. We exist in it and we have to take every care of it – it is our responsibility. \n\n“So for seven days.... It will look a little absurd in the beginning because we have never been taught to talk to our own body – and miracles can happen through it. They are already happening without our knowing it. When I am saying something to you, my hand follows in a gesture. I am talking to you – it is my mind that is communicating something to you. My body is following it. The body is en rapport with the mind. \n\n“When you want to raise the hand, you have to do nothing – you simply raise it. Just the very idea that you want to raise it and the body follows it; it is a miracle. In fact biology or physiology has not yet been able to explain how it happens. Because an idea is an idea; you want to raise your hand – it is an idea. How does this idea become transformed into a physical message to the hand? And it does not take any time at all – in a split second; sometimes without any time gap. \n\n“For example, I am talking to you and my hand will go on collaborating; there is no time gap. It is as if the body is running parallel to the mind. It is very sensitive – one should learn how to talk to it, and many things can be done.” Osho\n\n\nApp Features:\n\n- Guided relaxations\n- Journaling for your thoughts as you meditate\n- Reminders\n- High-quality audio files\n- Available in English, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, Chinese Traditional , Russian, French, Dutch, Hindi, Japanese, Portugues, Turkish, Hebrew, Korean, Svenska, Estonian",

    "description": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved",

    "description": "This app was developed independently of the MIT Scratch Team, which produces the Scratch programming language and online community. The Scratch name and Scratch cat are trademarks of MIT.\n\n\"Scratch 2 games\" brings you a whole bunch of video tutorials to get you going making your own games in the new web based version of scratch. This are not the sort of standard tutorials that you find on the web. During the videos you will be set tasks to do in scratch and hopefully you will be able to complete them on your own. However don't worry the next video in each project will show you how to complete the task!!\n\nSo what will you learn to build in this new version of Scratch? Well there are 3 games to be covered here. A leap back to retro games with \"Frogger\" and \"Breakout\", then there is also a guide to how to create your own 2 player \"top down racer\" game.\n\nThere's even a quiz in the app so you can test your scratch knowledge too!!\n\nScratch really is a fantastic way into learning programming and coding and this app hopefully will be a great asset to get you going with it.\n\nThis is a big app of just under 300Mb, because there is so much material in it. You will need to be hooked into your WiFi connection!!  Also suggest that you set up an account with Scratch before stepping into the screencasts.\n\n*TEACHERS* the point of this app is that kids can use the iPad alongside the pc to build their games in Scratch. You can just sit back and relax without having to plan anything. Oh and there is enough material to keep your students busy for around 6 hours, even if they don't manage to have a go at the extension tasks that are identified for all 3 games!!\n\nIF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING NO SOUND ON YOUR IPAD IT IS BECAUSE YOU NEED TO FLICK THE MUTE SWITCH NEXT TO YOUR VOLUME CONTROL.",

Your task is not just to pick up the calls, but also to react appropriately to the situation – sometimes giving first aid instructions is enough, at other times a police, fire department or paramedics’ intervention is a necessity.

The forces may use a variety of vehicles (from common ambulances to police helicopters), essential equipment (e.g., bulletproof vests, first aid kits and technical tools) and consist of team members with different abilities.\n\nPEOPLE’S LIVES ARE IN YOUR HANDS!\n\nMain features:\n\n- Over 50 recorded dialogues inspired by real calls: serious and dramatic, but sometimes also funny or annoying.\n- Real First Aid instructions.\n- Opportunity to play on any city in the world!\n- 6 selected cities in Career mode, featuring unique calls and events.\n- More than 140 types of reports to encounter.\n- 12 types of emergency vehicles (including helicopters, police cars and motorcycles).\n\n***\n(!)

    "description": "hearEQ builds your EQ skills to professional levels using custom ear training exercises, created just for you from your favourite songs. Simple, powerful, and fast, hearEQ is perfect for ear training on the go. Named one of \"The best iPhone and iPad apps for musicians\" (www.apppicker.com), here's what the experts have to say about hearEQ:\n\n\"When I found hearEQ, I knew this was a game-changer. From the ease of use and the ability to use your own music selections, hearEQ is perfectly designed to be the go-to choice for developing your ear. My students have shown tremendous improvements in mixing and productions, and I completely attribute this to hearEQ. Thanks Ten Kettles! Keep up the great work. You are making a difference!\" -Chandler Bridges, Ph.D., Professor (The Los Angeles Film School); Audio engineer (Will Smith, Aaliyah, Johnny Mathis, P-Diddy, J-Lo, Bette Midler, LeAnn Rimes, and more) with two Grammy-winning albums.\n\n“After half an hour with the app I had a noticeable improvement to my score, but I was also thinking in much clearer terms too!” -Tim Webb, www.discchord.com\n\n“This handy app is one of the greatest tools I've seen for helping you hear exactly how EQ adjustments affect your sound. Wish I would have had this when I was first learning how to mix live sound.” -James Wasem, www.greatchurchsound.com\n\n\"hearEQ…makes the experience of ear training enjoyable enough to seem like fun.  [It's] a great educational tool.\" -Tom Flint, Sound on Sound: The World's Best Recording Technology Magazine\n\n“The principle behind hearEQ is beautifully straightforward…even with a little repetition, things do start to improve and I suspect if you were to build some hearEQ into your daily musical routine, you would soon reap some positive benefits.” -John Walden, www.musicappblog.com\n\n----------------------------------\n\nEvery frequency range has a colour, a quality, a character. For sound engineers, musicians, and other enthusiasts, knowing how to apply this to an equalizer (EQ) can make a transformational change to your sound—whether you're mixing a live concert, a recording, or even playing music through iTunes.  (VIDEO @ www.hearEQ.com)\n\nIt's a simple app with a powerful promise:  if you learn the qualities of each frequency band—for example, cutting 4kHz puts sound in the background—then you can make equalization work for you, and truly transform your sound into something professional and beautiful. \n\nhearEQ uses your favourite songs on your device to create custom ear training exercises that a) teach you all about frequency bands, and b) help you really hone your EQ skills. A standard 10-band or 30-band* equalizer is used, just like you'd find in iTunes and on many professional sound mixers. Your song will be played back with a simple equalization applied—and you guess what it was! \n\n> Was it really clear, maybe a bit hollow? Could be a 1000 Hz cut. \n\n> Was it muddy? Maybe that's a 500 Hz boost. \n\n> Was it really present, almost too in-your-face? Sounds like a 4kHz boost. \n\nTen questions, ten frequencies, and then you get a score. Want to focus on just a few frequency bands to start? You can do that too. Keep at it, and you'll be an EQ master in no time.\n\nWant to learn more? Check out our site and the hearEQ video at www.hearEQ.com.\n\n\n*The 30-band equalizer is part of the \"Advanced EQ\" module, available as an in-app purchase within hearEQ.\n\nNOTE: hearEQ works with any track on your device, with the exception of tracks that prevent our EQ processing, such as DRM-protected tracks and cloud tracks (e.g., Apple Music). That said, hearEQ ships with several built-in practice tracks, so you'll be able to start EQing right away!",

    "description": "THE PREMIER IPAD ATLAS - with RETINA VECTOR MAPS\n\nThe World HD is unique in the app store because it includes both a complete set of country maps AND the largest world fact book.  These enable it to answer questions which Atlases and fact books cannot:  Atlases show you where countries are located, but have very little information about them; fact books tell you about each country, but their maps leave you guessing about where places are located.\n\n\n___________ HOW IT WORKS ___________\n\nThe interface is animated and interactive.  Touch a country on the world map and the Retina vector country map opens while the factbook slides onto the screen, each topic neatly organized as tiles along the edge of the map.  Touch a factbook tile and it zooms out to reveal detailed information about that topic.  Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the drop-down list and The World HD zooms in on it then opens the map and factbook.\n\nThe zoomable world map is not just the fastest way to select a country it also enables you to visualize and understand entire regions.  It is so intuitive and easy to explore that once you get started it's hard to stop!\n\n\n___________ FEATURES ___________\n\nRETINA VECTOR MAPS\n** Includes high-resolution Retina vector maps for EVERY COUNTRY built-in!  Unlike the other atlases, these maps remain in focus at all magnifications so you can easily see even the smallest detail.  These aren't the CIA maps found in the factbooks, they are used in printed atlases.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n** Contains 150+ MB of geopolitical and demographic information on 300 countries and regions.\n\nINNOVATIVE FACT BOOK PANEL\n** Presents each section of the fact book as tiles enabling you to quickly find what you need, while keeping the country map in view.\n\nHIGHLY ANIMATED INTERFACE\n** Responds to your touches and gestures so you can quickly find the information you are looking for.\n\nCIA WORLD FACTBOOK\n** This trusted source of current country information is built-in for every country, including sections on: introduction, geography, people, economy, communications, transportation, military, and transnational issues.\n\nWIKIPEDIA\n** View the live, community-written Wikipedia content for each country, island, and remote region within the app.\n\nSHOWS YOU where countries are located\n** Not sure where a country is located?  Select it on the country list and The World zooms to it on the world map and opens the Fact Book Panel\n\nUP TO DATE\n** The World is updated regularly and updates are always free of charge\n\nDESIGNED FOR YOUR IPAD\n** Thoughtfully uses the whole screen to present maps and data\n\nNO INTERNET CONNECTION is required\n** Except for live Wikipedia content, all data and maps are built-in",

The story is an action parody with great humor and a range of outcomes based on the choices you make. Many options inevitably lead to spectacular failure. The mechanics are classic point-and-click.\nWith an array of potential stories, the only consistent theme is the Toppat clan making one final move. As Henry, you have options to side with various parties, shifting your motives dramatically as you click your way through the game.You achieve completion by making the right decisions when prompted and getting to the end.

Deborah Blake’s approachable guidebook tempers serious magical purpose with humor and optimism. The book is rooted in traditional RWS Tarot, modernized with sage advice for the busy modern witch.

    "description": "Headphones are required.\nAudio game fully accessible to blind and visually impaired people.\n\nDoing it Right is an audio puzzle with brain-busting challenge. Test your hearing and logic.\nFollow the sound instructions and win the game. With each chapter and level instructions will become more difficult and mental discomfort stronger. Try to test yourself. It is harder than it seems at first sight.\nThe game consists of two modes: an endless and a normal one. A normal mode includes 11 chapters (60+ levels), while an endless mode can be played endlessly.\n\nHow to play?\nIn Doing It Right you need to follow some instructions, for example:\n- Left - swipe left.\n- No up - swipe any direction except up.\n- Repeat and Inversion do not apply to the entire instruction chain, but only to the last one. For example: if it was on the down, then Inversion means on the up.\nSometimes, the levels can be marked with a marker, color or sound. In this case, you should remember what a certain color corresponded to.  For example: in the Right is Red level, all instructions based on Right will be replaced with Red. The same is with the sound.",
