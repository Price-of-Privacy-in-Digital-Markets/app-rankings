    "description": "We are @moment and Pro Camera is the app we’ve always wanted. Manual controls, better video, long exposure and quick access to the settings we need. It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.\n\nFor Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR. Shoot in RAW (even in BURST), split focus / exposure, and manually control everything (exposure, iso, shutter speed, white balance and focus).\n\nFor Everyone Else - inspired by the pro’s we made the interface simple, fast, and easy to use. We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you. If you have any features, ideas, or feedback please email us at hello@shopmoment.com or DM us on Instagram @moment.\n\n## Premium Features\n+ NEW Timelapse mode - capture stunning time-lapse videos.\n+ Slow Shutter mode - long exposure shots with motion blur and light trails.\n\n## Photography Features\n+ Focus peaking - the green edges will help you dial in your focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ RAW and TIFF - Shoot photos in RAW format for better editing, or TIFF for high-quality printing.\n+ Split Focus and Exposure - Take control of tricky lighting scenarios.\n+ Full Manual - Control shutter speed, iso, exposure, focus, and white balance with easy to use sliders and double taps to reset.\n+ Burst mode - Capture burst shots in RAW format. This is big as now you can capture action with burst but at the uncompressed quality pros want with RAW.\n+ HEIF and HEVC - Seamless support for the latest Apple file formats across photos and videos.\n\n## Filmmaker Features\n+ Focus peaking - the yellow edge glow will help you find dial in the focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ Color Profiles - Select from default, flat, or log color profiles to get the most out of your files in post-processing.\n+ Video Bitrates - Get precise control over video quality with standard, medium, and high bitrates to choose from.\n+ RGB Histogram: Dial in your video color, balance, and exposure with a live RGB histogram.\n+ Waveform monitor - Evaluate video brightness and exposure across your image in real time.\n+ Audio meters - Get just the right sound levels with real-time, precise, dual-channel (when available) audio levels.\n+ Live Histogram - Get your exposure right every time.\n+ Video Stabilization - Make your videos buttery smooth.\n+ Precise Video - Change your resolution and frame rate on screen, without digging into a settings menu.\n+ Anamorphic - Use the Moment Anamorphic lens to shoot amazing, letterbox style photos and videos.\n\n## Works With\n+ Triple/Dual Lens Control - Manually control which side of the triple/dual lens you want to shoot with so you can use Moment lenses over either one.\n+ Moment Lens - select which lens you are shooting with.\n+ Moment Battery Case - Works with the DSLR-like shutter button on our photography cases for half-press and full-press capture. Take better photos, faster.\n+ Apple Watch - Use your watch as a remote to shoot photos or record videos.\n+ Siri Shortcuts - Quick access to capture a photo or start a video\n\nRAW and 3D shutter require an iPhone 6S or later (6S, 7, 8, X, XS, XR, SE)",

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos.

It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

When played as a solo instrument, the tabla is accompanied (usually on the harmonium or sarangi) by a continuous cyclical musical phrase or riff called the \"Lehra\" or \"Nagma\" (ostinato in western music) that keeps track of the \"aavartan\" or rythmic cycle in the chosen \"taal\".\n________________________________________\n\n◆ AND NOW PRESENTING - iLehra ◆\niLehra was the first electronic Lehra / Nagma player for the iPhone and iPod Touch, and its now available on the iPad as well! It provides accurate as well as pleasing lehra accompaniment for a wide variety of taals and raags on the Harmonium, Santoor, Violin, or the Flute. Innovative features include tanpura auto-tuned to the chosen lehra/raag, presets, tap-tempo, metronome, and extremely intuitive controls.\n\nSee the iLehra website for a YouTube demo:\n   http://iLehra.com\n________________________________________\n\n◆ KEY FEATURES ◆\n√ Plays 109 Lehras in 55+ raags for 25 taals\n√ Taals included:  Ada Chautaal(14), Basant Taal(9), Chartal-ki-Sawari(11), Chautaal(12), Dadra(6), Deepchandi(14), Dhamar(14), Ektaal(12), Faradost/Firdost(14), Ganesh Taal(21), Jhaptaal(10), Jhoomra(14), Keherva(8), Matta Taal(9), Pancham Sawari(15), Rudra Taal(11), Rupak(7), Sooltaal(10), Teentaal(16), as well as general lehras for 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, 10.5, 13, and 18 beats.\n√ Beautiful, realistic lehras on Harmonium, Violin, Flute, or Santoor!\n√ Full octave of pitch adjustments from C through B\n√ INTEGRATED AUTO-TUNER: Auto-Tune iLehra to your tabla, or use it to tune other instruments (microphone capability required such as iPhone built-in mic or 2nd/3rd generation iPod Touch with external microphone)\n√ BACKGROUND PLAY: Start playing the lehra and switch to another app, or play along with iPod music\n√ TAP TEMPO: just tap the beats on the bottom display and watch iLehra sync up!\n√ PRESETS: save your frequently-used combinations of pitch, taal, lehra, instrument & tempo as named presets.

    "description": "The CycleBeads app enables you to plan or prevent pregnancy easily and effectively by simply tracking your period each cycle. Just enter the date your period starts, and the app identifies your fertile and non-fertile days according to the patented Standard Days Method®. \n\nRESEARCH\nThis modern natural family planning method has been researched extensively in medical trials and is the only proven family planning method which allows you to manage your fertility simply by tracking your period. iCycleBeads is the only iPhone app in the world based on this method. It has been found to be 95% effective in perfect use and 88% effective in typical use.*\n\nCRITERIA FOR USE\nThe one medical criterion for using this method effectively is that you should have cycles between 26 and 32 days long**. Most women do, but not all. If you are unsure if your cycle is in this range, the CycleBeads app can be used to track your cycle lengths and will let you know if your cycles are in this range. \n\nYou can also take a self-screener at: www.cyclebeads.com/screen \n\nHOW TO USE\nTo use iCycleBeads, simply input the date your most recent period started. The app immediately lets you know what day of your cycle you are on, whether it is a potentially fertile day or an infertile day, and when your fertile days will occur this cycle, all based on the Standard Days Method. You can use this information to either plan pregnancy, avoid pregnancy, or just to track.  This information is provided in both a calendar format and in a visual representation of Cycle Beads.  \n\nKEY FEATURES:\n•A visual representations of your cycle based on the start date of your period in both calendar and CycleBeads formats\n•Customizable alerts notifying you when you are on your fertile days, when your fertile window is ending, and when you are likely to start your next period \n•Alerts reminding you to input your period start date or when you had a cycle outside the range of 26-32 days long\n•A notes feature which allows you to track key information that you may want to discuss with your health provider\n•Ongoing cycle data history so you can see the start dates of your previous cycles, the length of each cycle, and whether that cycle was in the range for using this method effectively.\n\nMORE INFORMATION\nFor more information on the research behind this family planning method, to watch a video on how it works, or to learn more about this family planning tool, visit www.CycleBeads.com \n\nMillions of women around the world have used this method as birth control, to plan pregnancies, or just to better understand their cycles. A portion of the proceeds from sales of all CycleBeads products including the iCycleBeads app, supports research to expand family planning options around the world, and help people make informed choices about their reproductive health. \n\nWe update iCycleBeads regularly.

    "description": "Whether you're a competitive lifter or just want to improve your strength and fitness, your one-rep max (1RM) is an essential tool. Calculate your max safely and easily, and then track it over time, on any lift with our easy-to-use calculator!\n\nIn the simplest terms, your 1RM is the amount of weight you can lift for one rep on any given lift. In general, it’s good to know your max for key lifts like the squat, bench press, and deadlift, but your 1RM is critical even if you never plan to train that heavy.\n\nMany lifting programs are designed with a percent of your rep max in mind, and may call for something like using 65% of your 1RM for a given exercise. When you see that, you have to either test for your 1RM or estimate it. Testing your 1RM can be pretty intense, and it requires a high degree of caution to avoid injury.\n\nFortunately, you can estimate your 1RM without testing it! Exercise scientists have devised a formula that's fairly accurate for most people, which is what powers this calculator. Our calculator makes it easy to calculate and track your 1RM and multiple percentages of it for every lift in the book!\n\nFeatures:\n\n· Calculate your 1RM and percentages\n\n· Choose from a variety of lifts (deadlift, bench press, squat, etc.), or add your own\n\n· Track and chart your 1RM history for each type of lift\n\n· Add notes each time you calculate your 1RM\n\n· Improve your weight training with articles by Bodybuilding.com experts\n\n· Choose imperial or metric system\n\n· Incredibly easy to use!",

    "description": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.
