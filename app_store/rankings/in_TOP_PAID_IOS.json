Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

Practicing Sargams each day does wonders to your “Sureelapan” as well as confidence.\nPracticing every day under watchful eyes of your Guru is the ideal way. But that is difficult these days.\nCome enjoy your daily practice with RiyaazPal. We will provide you with a perfectly  tuned harmonium, allow you to select your Sa and provide you with more than 25 ready  Sargams. Simply select your Sa, and type of music you sing, light or classical, and start practicing.\nAll Sargams will play on the harmonium in a manner an expert harmonium artist plays. Our harmonium provides automatic grace notes; and you will feel a smooth continuum as you sing Sargams.  Depending on your selection, you will get a Gandhar tuned harmonium (classical) or a tempered harmonium (light). Almost all of the commercially available harmoniums are equal tuned (also known as tempered tuning, or western style of tuning). Our harmoniums are correctly tuned based on type of music you select.\nIn addition, there is a virtual keyboard that allows you to practice any Sur for any length of time.\nSee for yourself how daily practice with RiyaazPal can truly improve your Sureelapan and confidence. \n\nAbout\nRiyaazPal is the first application of its kind that provides you with a real, perfectly tuned harmonium at your fingertips. Created “by artists” and “for artists”, this application will make your daily riyaaz enjoyable. The app contains\n•9 different “Sa”s (tonic notes), pick one you like\n•Ability to select your music type, light or classical. This results in right selection of the harmonium for you; tempered harmonium for light and Gandhar tuned for classical\n•More than 25 pre-made Sargams\n•Ability to adjust Sargam speed depending on your comfort level\n•Two unique “5 minutes” Sargams. These are especially for those people who don’t find time for daily riyaaz. If you have 5 extra minutes in your schedule, you can make good use of that time by practicing with either “5 minutes simple” or “5 minutes difficult” Sargams\n•A virtual keyboard that allows you to play and sing/practice any sur for any length of time. \n•Click here for frequently asked questions. \nUse a good quality headphone or a docking station for best experience.",

    "description": "DoubleTake by FiLMiC transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 15 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 13 series devices, iPhone 12 series devices, iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and newer.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 15, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nDoubleTake gives you an early look at the multi-cam capability that will be coming to our award-winning cinema camera app FiLMiC Pro.  \n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll.",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

Whether you've built up your collection for decades or just got sent an album full of b-sides of your favorite artist, you need a place to carry your own music.\n\nLet Doppi be that place. Doppi (pronounced doh-pie) raises the bar in iOS app design in an essentially simple music player, built just for your local music files.\n\nEnjoy your music with: \n\n• A beautifully simple interface\n• Fluid gesture-based navigation\n• Always-reachable search and playback controls\n\nSupports MP3, M4A, FLAC, and more. Browse and play music:\n\n• Received via AirDrop\n• Copied from the Files app\n• Shared from other apps (selecting \"Copy to Doppi\")\n• Added to the Doppi folder in Files or via iTunes File Sharing\n• Synced from iTunes\n• Downloaded from Cloud Music Library\n\n————\nImportant: \nDoppi does not support Apple Music offline downloads outside of Cloud Music Library.\n————\n\nWith Doppi:\n\nBig, Beautiful Artwork\nYour music's artwork takes center stage on the Now Playing screen and throughout your library.\n\nMake It Your Own\nChoose from 6 highlight colors and 32 beautiful icons, switch between 4 light and dark themes, rearrange your library tabs, and more—all from Preferences.\n\nSearch From Anywhere\nPull down from anywhere in your library to invoke Search. Hit Return to instantly trigger the top result.\n\nPlay and Add Quickly\nPlay an album or artist right from the library using their embedded Play buttons, and add songs to Up Next using the Add (+) buttons.\n\nMark Your Likes\nTap the heart on the player (or choose Like from a menu) to Like tracks. Liked music appears in the Liked Songs playlist, Liked Albums on Search, and is more likely to play in Shuffle All.\n\nMake Playlists\nCreate all-new playlists, duplicate them, or copy them from Apple Music. Tap and hold on anything to add those songs to a list.\n\nAdd Lyrics\nSearch for lyrics on the web right from the app and add them to your songs. Enjoy them on Doppi's beautiful player interface.\n\nManage Your Music\nEverything in your library has useful actions — just tap and hold to reveal a menu. For example, if you're not feeling some of your music, you can exclude it from Shuffle All, hide it from your library, or delete it (if it's from imported files).\n\nLess, But Better\nEvery screen in Doppi has been carefully designed with clean typography, pleasing contrast, and elegant motion. Enjoy your music without unnecessary distractions.\n\nEasily Readable\nDoppi fully supports Dynamic Type and includes high contrast themes, so your eyes won't get in the way of your ears.\n\nContinue Album\nEver shuffled your music, found a song you loved, and wished you could keep playing the album without stopping the song? Doppi can make it happen — just navigate to the album and press Play.\n\nGive your music the lovely home it deserves.\n\n————\nImportant:\nDoppi does not include any music. It was designed to play the music files that you own and that you transfer manually to your device. It does not support music from any streaming service.",

Play with friends or strangers in online play, challenge the AI, or play offline with friends face-to-face! \r\n\r\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t​he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens. \r\n\r\nKEY FEATURES:\r\n\r\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\r\n\r\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\r\n\r\n- Featuring original art by The Oatmeal\r\n\r\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\r\n \r\n- Digital versions of the hit expansions, including Streaking and Barking Kittens, as well as digital exclusive Betrayal and Party decks\r\n\r\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\r\n\r\nCreat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\r\n\r\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money.

I bet this app will make you smile or laugh at least once.\n\nMy name is Vince Kotchian, and I've been a GRE prep tutor since 2008. In this app, I've created flashcards for over 1300 GRE words and 160 word roots. Each vocab flashcard has a silly cartoon, a clear definition of the word with an example sentence, and a memorable mnemonic to make it easier to remember the word. \n\nHere's a mnemonic example so you know what I'm talking about: \"prodigal\" means \"wasteful\". The prodigal Prada gal spent $1500 on a pair of Prada boots. Get it? :)\n\nThe app's smart spaced repetition system shows you words when you need to review them to make your GRE vocabulary studying more efficient and effective. There's also a streak feature to help keep you motivated to use the app consistently. Download it today and start improving your GRE verbal score!\n\nGot a question, complaint, or suggestion regarding this app? Email Vince directly at vince@vincekotchian.com.",
