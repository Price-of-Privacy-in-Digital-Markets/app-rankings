You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method.

It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat. Also their support is brilliant, they responded in less than an hour of the query I emailed to them.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget, which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/",

    "description": "Know if someone unlocked your screen and is spying on your device! True security against physical access. It works if they know your password and even if no password is set for the lock-screen.\niAmNotified is the solution to definitively secure your device! \nIt acts as a watchdog that lets you know if someone accessed your iPhone or iPad while you were not looking. It can also alert people that you are monitoring the device, discouraging any malicious access.  \n\nNo one can access your device without the password. But...\n\nWhat happens if your sneaky colleague or friend peeks while you type it in? \nWhat if your partner or parents simply demand it? (\"Why don't you give me your password, are you hiding something?\".... does this sound familiar?). \nWhat if someone uses your fingerprint to unlock your device while you sleep? (yeah, it has happened, check the press).\n\nThey would have access to your entire life: pictures, videos, contacts, whatsapp conversations, facebook chats, emails (which mean access to any of your online accounts via password reset), etc.\nThey might even install malware to spy on you remotely!\n\nTHE WORST PART IS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE. \nThat you need to change your password. That a tracking virus is running on your device. That you have to alert your bank. That your competitor has stolen your confidential data.  That your partner knows about \"those\" pictures and conversations and you'd better prepare a good excuse....\nThat people you trust don't respect your privacy!\n\n\n+++ HOW IT WORKS +++\n! THE SIMPLEST APP EVER !\n1. open the App\n2. lock the screen\n\nThat's it! Your device is Secured!\n\nYou will immediately receive a notification on the lock-screen. The notification will remain there until the screen stays locked. If anyone unlocks the screen while you are away, the notification will not be there when you return, alerting you that someone had access to your device.\nThe notification changes every single time for extra security.\n\nThe History Log keeps track of the last notifications shown, so by-passing the system is virtually impossible. \n\n+++FEATURES +++\nDouble Function: use the app with STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS to catch anyone who is spying on you, or with DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS to let everybody know that you are monitoring any access to the device.\n\nYou choose what appears on the notification: \n\n+ STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS (simulate a useful notification, to disguise the true nature of iAmNotified)\n- Lucky Lottery Numbers - [Who doesn't play the lottery?  I mean... free money, right?!]\n- Famous Citations - [Because everyone needs some inspirational quotes every now and then]\n- Definition of a Complex Word - [Education is important! Anyone would want to expand his vocabulary]\n- Fake Stock Exchange Alert - [These are total random companies symbols and values. Not real data to be sued in the stock market!]\n\n+ DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS (showing that you are monitoring the device, will discourage people from accessing it)\n- Custom Message - [You choose what appears on the notification]\n- \"Device locked at: #current date and time#\" - [Shows the time of the last screen lock]\n- \"Access to this device is monitored. Unique notification ID: #securityID#\" \n\n*** PRO OPTIONS ***\nImprove your stealthiness with these advanced options\n\n- Secret Lock -> Launch iAmNotified without anyone near you noticing. When the option is activated, a black dimmed screen is shown when the app is opened, simulating the lock screen. Now you can secretly press the lock button to lock the screen, or wait for it to lock automatically. To access the app with the option activated, simply tap anywhere on the black screen.\n\n- Random Notification Time -> The notification appears at a random time within 2 minutes from the screen lock, instead of immediately after\n\nStart to feel in control of your device!",

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. For this reason, please familiarize yourself with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nAside from the cloud synchronization service, AnkiMobile also supports copying decks to and from your device via the USB cable and iTunes.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: http://ankisrs.net/docs/AnkiMobile.html\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "When we chant we use our vocal apparatus to produce the sound. The process brings us into the eternal NOW. When we write, a long lapse of time can pass between the time of writing and our re-reading. When we chant, the action brings us in the present moment. The process of chanting demands full attention, at least on the physical level. There is also the question of resonance. Chanting evokes and invokes resonance in letters and words. All mantra can be chanted in three forms, the vachika form(chanting externally, uttering sound) is the between, and the lalitha is the grossest.Yet, this requires full knowledge of what one is doing. It follows that when we chant we are in the NOW, we are vibrating, and we know what we are uttering so that when we move to the subtlest plane.",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year. \n  \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves or a White Balance picker. The Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows or sharpen your photo, among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. Use our built-in RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and keep using the tools you are already familiar with.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nEVERYTHING INCLUDED - no IAPs\nCamera+ 2 works great on iPhone and iPad. Use the same tools consistently across all your devices, and take advantage of multitasking in iPad. All features are included in your purchase for all platforms - no in-app purchases required.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.\n\nLIGHTBOX\nPhotos taken with Camera+ 2 go to the Lightbox by default. Filter them easily to focus on the ones you want to work on, and use the built-in editors to create the exact look you are aiming for. Save or share the final versions when you are done.",

    "description": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIt's not easy to outperform ourselves after 11 years of delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features, but we did it! Again!\n\nAlready top in its class, and everybody's favorite go-to tool, GoodReader just got significantly better.\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs when you're on the go with your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nA part of the Pro Pack (*) add-on, this wonderful new feature allows you to split an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): Pro Pack® is a paid add-on, sold separately from inside the app, as an in-app purchase.",

    "description": "The Sealed Nectar | Biography of Prophet Muhammad\n\nA complete authoritative audiobook on the life of Prophet Muhammad PBUH by Sheikh Safi-ur-Rahman al-Mubarkpuri. The Sealed Nectar was honoured by the World Muslim League as first prize winner book. Whoever wants to know the whole life style of the Prophet in detail must listen to this 23 hour and 32 minute audiobook.\n\nMuhammad (peace be upon him) is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him, are severe against the disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (fore heads) from the traces of prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurah (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those among them who believe and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (Paradise). (Al-Fath: 29)\n\nThe Prophet Muhammad PBUH said: \"The example of guidance and knowledge with which Allah has sent me is like abundant rain falling on the earth. Some of which was fertile soil that absorbed rain-water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it was hard and held the rain-water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it for drinking (making their animals drink from it) and to irrigate the land for cultivation. (And) a portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's Religion (Islam) and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah (Azawajal) has revealed through me (the Prophet) and learns and then teaches it to others. The (last example is that of a) person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's Guidance revealed through me (he is like that barren land).\" (Al-Mukarramah)",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",

The game departs its familiar desert setting and delves into the depths of cities infested by zombies. \n\nMULTI-TIERED LEVELS:\nLevels are now multi-tiered!

Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.\n\nDESTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES\nVehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.\n\nMORE ZOMBIES. MORE DESTRUCTION. MORE MAYHEM.\nWhat are you waiting for?

    "description": "The best camera is the one you have with you. But what if that camera was improved with pro features, a gorgeous interface, intuitive controls, and was always with you?\n\nThat camera is Obscura.\n\n\nCamera\n————————————————\nObscura is designed to make it fast and easy to capture stunning images. Whether you're shooting in portrait or landscape, the Control Wheel fits into your hand perfectly. You won't be fumbling around trying to capture a photo when you're in a hurry – everything is accessible with one thumb. Finely tuned haptic feedback gives the devices a sense of physicality, so you can feel every adjustment.\n\nFormat\n————\nYou can shoot in a wide range of formats:\n\n• RAW - capture more details and allow for a greater amount of flexibility when editing.\n\n• HEIC - a new image format that uses advanced compression for high quality files at smaller sizes.\n\n• JPEG - You can never really go wrong with JPEG, can you? It just works everywhere.\n\n• Live Photo - combine high resolution photos with video clips that bring your images to life.\n\n• Depth - allows you to apply exciting portrait mode effects and more.\n\n\nFilters\n————\nObscura includes a bunch of gorgeous filters to add style to your images. \nThere are 19 included filters, perfect for a wide range of scenes.\n\n• A Sepia filter unlocked by sharing the app with friends\n\n• A Black & White filter pack, including 8 filters. Especially good for dealing with low light and striking architecture.\n\n• An Analogue filter pack, including 7 filters. These work great for giving a cinematic look to your images.\n\n\nOther Camera Features\n————\nObscura has all the features you expect in a great camera app, including:\n• Flash control\n• Grids\n• Shutter Timer\n• Spirit Level\n\n\nLibrary\n————————————————\nWith a single swipe you can browse your library. \nBut Obscura doesn’t just have a simple image browser, it’s much more powerful than that. Here’s what you can do:\n\n• Edit - Apply Obscura’s gorgeous filters to images you’ve just captured (or images from other, lesser camera apps). You can save the filtered image as an adjustment, or as a new copy. \n\n• Share - There’s a good old share sheet, so you can share with your friends, and open images in other apps.\n\n• Copy - quickly copy an image to the clipboard, so you can share it with ease.\n\n• Favourite - Mark an image as favourite. Simple.\n\n• Hide - Not every image is for everyone to see. It’s cool. We get it.\n\n• Delete - Goodbye forever little photo.\n\n• Trash - Obscura has a neat little feature where you can add photos to a special trash album, so you can delete them all in one go. Efficient. \n\n\nSettings\n————————————————\nWith a wide range of customisation options, Obscura works your way. You can change the effects of gestures, secondary capture formats, and even the app icon! \n\n\nPrivacy\n————————————————\nWe believe that your personal information belongs to you. Obscura doesn’t collect any information about you, so there’s nothing to share with third parties, nothing can be hacked or leaked, because we don’t have it. We think that’s best for everyone. \n\nThe only data we see is the opt-in analytics that’s automatically collected by iOS. See more about it at apple.com/privacy\n\n\nExtras\n————————————————\nObscura has a Notification Center widget, which makes it quick and easy to access the app from the lock screen.\n\nPress firmly on the app icon on your home screen to quickly jump to some of Obscura’s features.\n\n\nRequirements\n————————————————\nNot all features are available on every device :( \n\nFocus Peaking - requires iPhone 6 or newer\nRAW capture - requires iPhone 6S or newer\nHEIC capture - requires iPhone 7 or newer\nDepth Capture - requires Dual Camera (iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X)\nAdvanced Haptic Feedback - requires iPhone 7 or newer\n\n\n————————————————\n\n\nMade by Ben Rice McCarthy\nhttp://www.benricemccarthy.com/\n\nMore info at\nhttp://obscura.camera",

    "description": "Papa's Burgeria is now available to play on the go, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.  Grill, stack, and serve burgers in a brand-new way!  \r\n\r\nYou're left in charge of Papa Louie's famous Burgeria, where you'll learn to take orders, grill patties, add toppings, and serve burgers to all of your crazy customers.  You need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls that feel just right in the palm of your hand: Head to the Order Station to keep an eye out for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Grill Station to drag patties onto the grill and flip burgers to cook them evenly.  Jump to the Build Station to carefully craft your sandwiches with toppings and sauces exactly how they ordered, and deliver the finished burger to earn points and tips!\r\n\r\nEach Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the burger-building process.  With full multi-touch support, the process is more fun than ever before!  Tap many burgers at once to flip them all on the grill, or keep one finger on the Build Station's bin slider for even better precision when building.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up. As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Burgeria!  Papa's Burgeria To Go also features unlockable toppings that aren't available in previous versions!\r\n\r\n**NEW FOR PAPA'S BURGERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  Use buttons in the top corners to switch Order Tickets without having to drag them back and forth.  You can also view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nGRILL STATION - We've made keeping track of your burgers easier than ever, with Timers stuck in each burger patty that you can read at a glance, showing the cooking time and how each side is cooked.  You can also buy Alarms in the Shop to add onto each Timer, so you'll get an alert when it's time to flip or remove a burger.  With multi-touch support, you can quickly flip and remove burgers by using multiple fingers.  Try a triple-tap to flip three patties in a row!\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - With a traditional drag-and-drop system, your finger would block your view, so we've completely changed the Build Station to work on smaller screens.  You'll swipe a carousel of Topping Bins across the top of the screen, and slide it carefully to line up toppings with the burger below.  Simply tap on the bottom of the screen to drop a topping from the bin above!  You can also tap a button to swap your Topping Bins with Burger Bins, which hold all of the patties you've cooked on the grill.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the bottom of the screen, so stacking burgers is a breeze!\r\n\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on burger shop game in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between grilling, stacking, and serving\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- Over 60 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- Over 50 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Burgeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.  If you're looking for large-screen gameplay, check out the original \"Papa's Burgeria\" for iPad!",

    "description": "The ultimate posing reference for both photographers and models.\nIf you ever run out of ideas, get stuck in creativity or simply need some guidance when photographing people, you can use Posing App as a \"posing cheat sheet\". Many pro photographers use such a technique when preparing for and during the photo shoot. During a photo shoot don’t hesitate to discuss with your subjects which pose is or isn’t working in any particular situation. It’s very productive and you will feel more confident in what you are doing.\n\nMerged in the practical mobile app format, all of the included poses in Posing App come with easy to understand descriptions and expressive hand drawn illustrations. In contrast to using real photos as samples, illustrations are only body outlines, so it's very simple for a model to understand and recreate the pose. Illustrations aren't in any way restrictive either, the model can be creative and come up with different variants on her own. Initial pose works simply as guidance for something to start with.\n\nA variety of posing categories are available in Posing App: Children, Couples, Women, Men, Groups and Weddings. Over 300 poses are included offering a wide choice in any modeling scenario. A special Glamour section is available as in-app purchase including additional 86 carefully selected glamour poses for female models. While browsing the poses, use the \"Add to favorites\" feature for fast access during a photo shoot.\n\nIn addition, a collection of tips & tricks about people photography is compiled for easy reference. Topics include: \"Basics of People Photography\", \"Face Expressions\", \"Head, Hand and Leg Positioning\", \"Accentuating Different Body Parts\", \"Composition and Equipment Advice for Photographers\".\n\nUse the collection of poses both as guidance and creative source for taking beautiful, creative and outstanding photos!\n\nPosing App is in English.",

    "description": "7 sevens is better than ever!  A simple, yet addicting number matching puzzle game. Drop numbers, break blocks, get huge high scores, and challenge your friends!  As long as you can count to seven you'll love 7 sevens!\n\nThe idea is to keep your board clear by creating clusters of the correct number of tiles with the same number on the tile to remove them.  For example, 4 connected fours will disappear.  Gray blocks will also appear and can be cleared by creating adjacent clusters.  \n\nWe listened to our users and added in a new helper called Lift, which allows you to pull a tile off the top of a column and reposition it on the board -- great for fixing those misplaced tiles!  We also added the ability to see the next tile coming and adjusted the end game to eliminate too many consecutive gray blocks from raining down on you.\n\nUser reviews:\n\n***** “Easy rules & terribly fun, addictive play!! Great game!!” - Spinnin' Wheeler\n\n***** “I don't do a lot of games on my pad, but I just love this one. I have found it to be quite addictive. Just love it!” - lal1234!\n\n***** “The best game ever!!! Love it, love it, love it.” - gstauros\n\nHow to Play: \n*Match up the correct number of tiles with the corresponding number on the tile. 2 twos disappear when placed next to one another. 3 threes - boom! 4 fours, 5 fives, 6 sixes, and -- you guessed it -- 7 sevens. \n*Each round you complete scores you bonus points, but also drops 7 new tiles on your board.\n*Gray blocks get in your way. Make matches to clear them away or use the powerful 1 tile to eliminate them right away. The more you clear, the bigger your score booster will become!\n*Save a tile for later and swap it in when you need it using the Swap helper \n*Use the powerful Lift helper to reposition a tile from the top of any column\n*When your board is full it’s game over. Share your score, challenge your friends, then start again to beat your own high score or go for the number 1 spot on the leaderboard\n\nThe great gameplay is complemented by beautiful graphics and a melodic soundtrack. You’ll find yourself losing hours to the complex simplicity of 7 sevens.\n\nDownload it now!",

Regular use of this app can help you become more self disciplined to:\n\n* eat more healthier food\n* exercise regularly\n* avoid drugs\n* better control our alcohol intake\n* better manage gambling habits \n* quit smoking\n\nOur life enhancing technology was built thanks to awards granted to ZenZone by the UK Government (via the London Development Agency) and the European Commission (via the European Regional Development Fund). \n\nThis allowed us to work with the world's leading technologists, neuroscientists and psychologists, in particular Professor Anthony Steed, Dr David Oakley and Dr Val Walters (UCL University, London) & Professor Mick Grierson (Goldsmiths University, London) to create a paradigm shift in how technology can help the masses.  \n\nFeatures of ZenZone include: \n* Real time measurement and instant visual feedback of your state of mind\n * Media clips selected and delivered based on your attention and meditation levels\n * Personal results score to track how well you do in each session\n * Exportable session data for off-line analysis\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  1) For full functionality, this app requires a brainwave headset sensor to be purchased separately. We use the sensor data in real time to personalize your experience. It is still possible to use the app without buying a headset sensor and users who choose to proceed in this way have reported considerable benefits.

    "description": "A hand sanitizer is your best defense against viruses when you're out running errands and can't get to a sink to wash your hands. As a general rule, you should avoid touching your nose, eyes, or mouth with unwashed hands. There are some hand sanitizers that are alcohol-free, and these won't be as effective in killing bacteria and viruses. A hand sanitizer consists of a pretty basic formula, and it's easy to make your own at home if your local pharmacy or retailer is running low.\nWe over here are using WHO recommend formulation in the app. Just put how much sanitizer you want to make in mL and then the app will provide you the composition of IPA, water, glycerol, Hydrogen peroxide mix them together. \nOnly pharmacopoeial quality reagents should be used (e.g. The International Pharmacopoeia) and not technical grade products.\nThis app is just for reference purposes and for helping people to make hand sanitizer at home. Use it with your own discretion. These Calculations Are Based On WHO recomendations given on their website - \"Guide To Local Production: WHO-recommended Handrub Formulation\".",

    "description": "Increase your chances of winning the lottery with Lottery Balls. \n\nEver noticed how there's rollover after rollover without a winner and then multiple people hit the jackpot at the same time. There's a reason for that; people are all picking their numbers the same way. \n\nYou can beat this trend. Lottery Balls uses highly advanced randomising algorithms to find the numbers that other people aren't choosing. \n\nAs well as helping you win the top prize and not having to share it, Lottery Balls increases your chances of winning the smaller prizes. When using other random number generators, including the \"lucky dip\" available at retailers, each row of numbers will be produced in isolation. Using their method, if you're buying more than one ticket, you'll find you're repeating the same number on several lines. That's fine if all you're interested in is the jackpot, but for smaller prizes, you've got a better chance of winning if you cover a wider range of numbers. That's why Lottery Balls generates multiple lines holistically, without repeating any numbers across the different tickets. \n\nEver forgotten to buy your ticket? Lottery Balls can remind you on the day of the draw to go out and get it before it's too late. \n\nLike playing the same numbers every week? Lottery Balls can save your favorite numbers for quick and easy access every time. \n\nLottery Balls works with any lottery. We've even added built-in generation rules for many popular worldwide lotteries. \n\nThese include:\nUSA\nPowerball\nMega Millions\nLotto America\nFlorida Lotto\nCash4Life\nJackpot Triple Play\nFantasy 5\nPick 5\nPick 4\nPick 3\nPick 2\n2by2\nGimme 5\nMegabucks\nLucky For Life\nTexas Two Step\nSuperLotto Plus\n\nEurope\nEuromillions\n\nUK\nLotto\nSet For Life\nThunderball\nHealth Lottery\n\nIreland\nLotto\nDaily Million\n\nChina\n双色球 (Double Colour Ball)\n福彩3 D (3D Lottery)\n七乐彩 (Lucky 7)\n超级大乐透 (Super Lotto)\n7星彩 (Lucky 7)\n排列5 (Order of 5)\n排列3 (Order of 3)\n六合彩 (Mark Six Lottery)\n\nAustralia\nAustralian Powerball\nMonday & Wednesday Lotto\nOz Lotto\nTattsLotto\n\nCanada\nDaily Grand\nDaily Keno\nLottario\nLotto 649\nLotto Max\nPick-2\nPick-3\nPick-4\n\nSouth Africa\nDAILY LOTTO\nLOTTO\nPowerBall\n\nJapan\nハロウィンジャンボ宝くじ (Jumbo Lottery)\nロト7 (Loto 7)\nロト6 (Loto 6)\nミニロト (Mini Loto)\nナンバーズ4 (Numbers4)\nナンバーズ3 (Numbers3)\n\nWe’re adding more and more of these all the time and we’d love to hear your suggestions for what you’d like included.

    "description": "Hydra offers innovative photo capture technology, and lets you take beautiful pictures even in the most difficult lighting conditions, which makes it a great companion to iOS Camera app.\n\n“The Hydra app from Belgian company Creaceed is one of the more interesting iOS camera apps we have seen in the recent past.”\n— DPReview\n\n“Hydra is for people who enjoy iPhone photography at a higher and more rewarding level.”\n— David Robinson (iPhonographer)\n\n\"Hydra has the particularity of offering original features, which are missing from many competing apps.\"\n— iPhon.fr\n\nHydra captures more light by merging up to 60 frames to make a single high-quality picture (less noise, more highlights/shadows) on iPhone and iPad. Hydra also goes beyond the 8- or 12-megapixel sensor limit, with up to 32-megapixel high-resolution images. It uses the latest evolutions of iPhone and iPad camera hardware, as well as the latest camera APIs and GPU rendering technologies.\n\nHydra provides 5 specific capture modes: HDR, Video-HDR, Lo-Light, Zoom, and Hi-res modes. \n\n• Hydra's High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is based on an alternate method that captures up to 20 images and that is made to handle even the most difficult lighting conditions. \n• Video-HDR uses single-image tone mapping and device-specific sensor mode to create stunning videos. \n• Lo-Light mode removes sensor noise by merging together multiple images and amplifying light by a factor of 10 to provide a better image quality.\n• Zoom mode uses real-time, super-resolution technique to recreate missing pixels from hand motion, producing 2x, 4x and 8x (telephoto lens) scale factors with more details than the standard digital zooming technique(*).\n• Hi-res mode produces up to 32MP images from the regular 8 or 12MP camera sensor, providing finer details in captured image(*).\n• Hydra supports the telephoto & front cameras respectively in Zoom and Lo-Light/HDR modes to shoot portraits & selfies.\n• Camera support: ultra wide, wide, telephoto, and front facing.\n\nHydra also features a photo gallery for reviewing images and their metadata, directly linked with built-in iOS photo album, thus avoiding duplicates and allowing to flag as favorites.\n\n(*) recommended for static scenes or distant scenery. Rendering artifacts can occur for scenes with parallax and for moving subjects.",
