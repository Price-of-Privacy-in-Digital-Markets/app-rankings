    "description": "I've always liked wearing a lunar complication on my Apple Watch.  There is something both visually delightful but yet also slightly geeky about it.  But I was unable to find a complication that provided an astronomically accurate moon display...which just kinda bothered me.  So I made Geneva Moon.\n\nGeneva Moon seeks to provide a highly accurate, visually pleasing indication of what the moon looks like right now, right where you are.  My goal was to make it so that if you look down at your wrist and then up into the sky the images you see should match.  \n\nIt includes a robust set of complications for every watch face type.  \n\nChoose between either a visually rich 'actual ' appearance or a more simplified version, to fit your own personal style.\n\nThe main display indicates the current azimuth and elevation of the moon along the horizon along with a visual indication of its phase and orientation. \n\nRotate the Digital Crown to shift forward and backwards through time and see how the moon will shift (tap on the screen to reset to now)\n\nOn Apple Watches equipped with a compass (Series 5) you can have Geneva Moon orient itself towards the actual moon to make it easier to locate the moon in the sky.\n\nThank you for considering Geneva Moon, I hope you enjoy having the moon on your wrist as much I do.  \n\n—Dave",

    "description": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved",

    "description": "Hey you! Yeah you! Shouldn't you be looking for Camera+ 2 instead? Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots.",

    "description": "\"Unruly Heroes” is a 2D action-adventure mobile game developed by the indie team at Magic Design Studios and published by Perfect World. The story is inspired by China’s first mythological novel \"Journey to the West” and strives to bring players an innovative experience through a fantastical art style and hilarious plot.\nSince the dawn of time, Buddhist scripture held the balance between Heaven, Earth, and the myriad creatures. However, as Evil’s wickedness began to grow, this delicate balance was thrown into chaos when the divine scripture was torn to pieces and scattered across the land. Those creatures that have encountered the mythical power of the fragments inherited unprecedented power. In doing so, this newfound strength kindled their heart’s innermost wickedness, turning them into horrifying monsters. With a world in chaos, a master and his three disciples accept Guan Yin’s decree and set out to reunite the fragments into a new scripture.\nThe game follows the journey of a master and his three disciples as they fight, solve puzzles, collect loot, parkour, platform and more on their mystical demon-slaying adventure. You must capitalize on their special attacks and holy relics in a battle of wit and bravery against demons to complete their pilgrimage in reuniting the scripture.\nFollowing its release on Steam and consoles, the mobile edition of “Unruly Heroes” is now available!\nHighlights:\nFantastic hand-drawn art style—Rich and in-depth level design illustrates a vivid sense of realism.\nSwitch between the master and disciples—Effortlessly switch between the four characters both in and out of combat to overcome puzzles and obstacles.\nRich and varied gameplay—Over ten different gameplay elements including: fighting, puzzle solving, loot collecting, parkour, platforming and more.\n\nAwards\n“Unruly Heroes” won the 47th Annie Award for best game character animation.\n\nFacebook: @UnrulyHeroesGame\nDeveloper Info: Magic Design Studios\nOfficial website: www.magicdesignstudios.com",

    "description": "\"Catan\", the legendary strategy game provides gaming fun anytime, anywhere.\n\nTrue to the original game, you can compete with up to four players for the most settlements, the longest roads and the largest army. You can trade with each other and claim the precious land with all its resources.\n\nThe game allows you to challenge other Catan fans online via cross-platform multiplayer to prove your strategy skills or play against the AI:\nVarious computer opponents, each with their own individual characteristics, will prove themselves worthy competitors: the pirate Jean, who knows no compromise, Vincent the merchant, who never allows himself to be cheated, Sean the knight, who takes what is rightfully his...\n\nThe popular Catan expansions \"Seafarers\", \"Cities and Knights\" and two new special scenarios are available as In-App purchases.\n\nThe complete Seafarers expansion includes more than 10 additional scenarios with an extensive campaign. Become Harbormaster, discover new islands and extra game elements like ships, gold fields, treasures and pirates. Ahoy!\n\nThe Cities and Knights expansion introduces various new gameplay mechanics that add even more variety to Catan. Invest new trade goods in city improvements to build one of the three metropolises of Catan – but beware of the barbarians attracted by Catan’s new wealth! You’ll need your best knights to fend them off! C&K contains a short campaign and 7 challenging maps.\n\nExciting adventures await you in the two new scenarios \"Enchanted Land\" and \"The Great Canal\". Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****",

    "description": "Hydra offers innovative photo capture technology, and lets you take beautiful pictures even in the most difficult lighting conditions, which makes it a great companion to iOS Camera app.\n\n“The Hydra app from Belgian company Creaceed is one of the more interesting iOS camera apps we have seen in the recent past.”\n— DPReview\n\n“Hydra is for people who enjoy iPhone photography at a higher and more rewarding level.”\n— David Robinson (iPhonographer)\n\n\"Hydra has the particularity of offering original features, which are missing from many competing apps.\"\n— iPhon.fr\n\nHydra captures more light by merging up to 60 frames to make a single high-quality picture (less noise, more highlights/shadows) on iPhone and iPad. Hydra also goes beyond the 8- or 12-megapixel sensor limit, with up to 32-megapixel high-resolution images. It uses the latest evolutions of iPhone and iPad camera hardware, as well as the latest camera APIs and GPU rendering technologies.\n\nHydra provides 5 specific capture modes: HDR, Video-HDR, Lo-Light, Zoom, and Hi-res modes. \n\n• Hydra's High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is based on an alternate method that captures up to 20 images and that is made to handle even the most difficult lighting conditions. \n• Video-HDR uses single-image tone mapping and device-specific sensor mode to create stunning videos. \n• Lo-Light mode removes sensor noise by merging together multiple images and amplifying light by a factor of 10 to provide a better image quality.\n• Zoom mode uses real-time, super-resolution technique to recreate missing pixels from hand motion, producing 2x, 4x and 8x (telephoto lens) scale factors with more details than the standard digital zooming technique(*).\n• Hi-res mode produces up to 32MP images from the regular 8 or 12MP camera sensor, providing finer details in captured image(*).\n• Hydra supports the telephoto & front cameras respectively in Zoom and Lo-Light/HDR modes to shoot portraits & selfies.\n• Camera support: ultra wide, wide, telephoto, and front facing.\n\nHydra also features a photo gallery for reviewing images and their metadata, directly linked with built-in iOS photo album, thus avoiding duplicates and allowing to flag as favorites.\n\n(*) recommended for static scenes or distant scenery. Rendering artifacts can occur for scenes with parallax and for moving subjects.",

It is also very hard, and I love it for that.” ***\n84/100 – PC Gamer\n \n***”It evokes lot of the more demanding thrills that modern games have left behind, the grit and the hard won satisfaction of overcoming intimidating challenges, or the experimental fun of spending hours tinkering with all the different ways you can play through a big, open-ended level. I had a blast inching my way through pretty much all of the harder stages in this game and I also think you might have a blast with it too.” ***\nSuper Bunnyhop\n \n“It’s a thing of beauty and manages to capture the planning and satisfying execution of more complex strategy games, as well as the gung-ho and the popping-off of growly man in military shooters. (...) It’s probably the best man-shootery game I’ve played in years.”\nIndie Statik\n \nDoor Kickers mixes old school, no-quarter action with modern ergonomic interfaces and puts you in command of a SWAT team during a tactical intervention.\n \nAnalyze the situation, plan team routes, choose equipment and breach points and coordinate multiple troopers to reach the hostage room before the bad guys get to press that trigger.\n \nIt may sound daunting, and like real world CQB combat, it sure is. But most levels can be completed in minutes and on the fly improvisation works. Achieving the perfect planning, getting the mission done with no false steps and losing no people, that’s a skill harder to master.\nQuick Points:\n§ 80 single missions, 6 campaigns and unlimited gameplay via mission generator\n§ Over 65 weapons and gear items to use and overcome the enemy.\n§ Top Down perspective  for optimal tactical analysis\n§ Real Time With Free Pause\n§ No turns, no hexes, no action points or awkward interfaces\n§ Realistic but action packed\n§ Non-linear levels, freeform gameplay\n\nWebsite https://inthekillhouse.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/KillHouseGames\nTwitter - @inthekillhouse",

Alan Meier \n-- “If you want a recording app that will get out of the way and just let you be creative, you just found it.” -- Dave Merson-Hess, indie film composer\n-- “Loopy 2 is by far the best looper for the iPhone we’ve seen to date” -- iOS Recording\n\nCompatible with the Audiobus app: Record and loop live audio directly from other Audiobus-compatible apps!\n\nWhile other music creation apps tend to be either powerful but difficult to learn, or easy to use but limited in features, Loopy doesn't compromise. Loopy offers a sleek, expressive, instantly understandable interface that beginners can start using effectively straight away. It's fun, right from the start. \n\nMore advanced users, however, will not be disappointed by Loopy's rich feature set, with extra features many other loopers just don't have.

You can have a baby monitor with unlimited gear that can be used anywhere without worrying about a weak WiFi signal.\n\nACTIVITY LOG\nBaby Monitor 3G allows you to check, how often was your baby awake, discover its sleeping patterns and replay sounds from current or any previous monitoring.\n\nNIGHT MODE\nThis feature turns the app into a night mode so you can comfortably check your phone placed on the nightstand even during the night without any unnecessary distraction.\n\nEVERY NOISE\nAre you not sure what the little sound you barely hear is? Sensitize the sound for a moment so you can hear every tiny sound from your baby’s room.\n\nTALK TO YOUR BABY\nSimply press a button and speak. Your child will be always one tap away from you.\n\nLULLABIES\nYou can soothe your baby to sleep by playing them some calming music. Lullabies can be imported from the music library or Baby Dreambox app.\n\nNIGHT LIGHT\nSmart night light with adjustable intensity makes it possible to view your baby, even when it’s dark.\n\nPERSONALISATION\nMake Baby Monitor 3G truly yours. You can set it up with the name of your baby, and the app looks differently depending on whether you have a baby boy or baby girl.\n\nSECURE AND RELIABLE\nReliability and privacy are our biggest concerns. You always know the battery level of the baby station, and stability of the internet connection is carefully monitored. In the unlikely event, something goes amiss, you’re notified immediately.\n\nNote about privacy\nWe respect your privacy and that’s why we do not store any data transferred through Baby Monitor 3G or any personal information. The entire connection is encrypted by industry standard SSL. You can find out more details at babymonitor3G.com/privacy\n\nTo see how video works and find more information, go to http://babymonitor3g.com\n\nPlease send us your feedback to support@tappytaps.com.

We can further dissect and observe the complex structure of its various organ systems right on our iOS devices using an Apple pencil or your finger. \nThus we get best of both worlds as we get to successfully observe and learn about the structure of a frog and yet cause no harm to life.

By becoming a Rider, you too can befriend countless Monsties, riding them as you explore a vast, exciting world. Join the adventure and \"Ride On!\"\r\n\r\n• Game Features\r\n- Recruit countless Monsties!\r\nMonsties, and the bonds you form with them, are the backbone of your adventure.

    "description": "AutoPad is the easiest way to bring ambient pad loops into your mix!\n\nAutoPad plays back a seamlessly looped set of sample-based drones that provide subtle structure to your live performances and recordings. Simply tap a key, and AutoPad will provide a tasteful soundscape that plays for as long as you like. Natural crossfades between keys are handled automatically.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- AutoPad has two modes: LIVE mode gives you instant access to all twelve keys, while SETLIST mode allows you to create a custom list of songs.\n\n- AutoPad comes with 10 carefully designed pad sounds. Each one provides a unique atmosphere in all 12 keys.\n\n- Expand your sound library by importing your own pads or by purchasing one of the in-app sound packs.\n\n- AutoPad comes with a fully-featured AUv3 plugin! Run AutoPad alongside other music apps in your favorite AUv3 host.\n\n- AutoPad features a built-in metronome. Keep your band locked in without needing to lug around a tracks rig.\n\n- AutoPad's menu gives you control over crossfade time, two filters, reverb amount, pan, and volume.\n\n- AutoPad responds to MIDI! Plug in a MIDI controller or use a MIDI-enabled app to control AutoPad.\n\n- AutoPad features a dark color scheme that is easy on the eyes and performs well on the stage.\n\nNote on use: \n\nAutoPad sounds great in a variety of contexts, but please make sure you understand the intended use before purchase.\n\nAutoPad's sounds include the root, fifth, and octave. As such, they can be used in a major or minor context. They are designed to be played softly and continuously behind live musicians. When using AutoPad in worship music, it is not necessary to change the pad with each chord change. For example, if you have a song in the key of E, you can play a pad in E for the duration of the song.",

    "description": "Download Electronics Detector and search suspicious places for hidden spy cameras / devices and make sure no one is spying on you now!\n\nWHY USE ELECTRONICS DETECTOR:\n\n# Hidden spy cameras are very cheap and small, always hidden in locations like your Airbnb room, hotel room, fitting room and toilet cubicle. \n\n# A cheap option to help you find these hidden spy cameras to protect your privacy.\n\n# Easy to carry around, it is an app programmed to use the complicated hardware in the phone to detect electronics.\n\n# Very helpful when you are renting a room, travelling, staying over at a friends’ or colleagues’ place.\n\n# Easy to use, simple instructions and video demonstration included in the app.\n\n# Low price to pay for something which will help to protect your privacy!\n\nHOW TO USE IT:\n\n1)\tThe app will detect electromagnetic wave emitted by electronics, including spy cameras and listening devices.\n\n2)\tTurn on the app and it will display the value of electromagnetic radiation. \nThere are two types of alarm:\n\n“Warning”: Indicator will change to amber color. Default threshold is 55. Indicate suspicion.\n\n“Alert”: Indicator will change to red color and alarm will sound/vibrate. Default threshold is 90. High probability a device is detected.\n\nThe default setting can be changed easily using the Sensitivity Bar or Manual Input Overwrite to suit your environment and phone.\n\n3)\tThere is a demo video in the app for locating “Sensor Area”.\n\nFor every phone, there is a special “Sensor Area”. Activate the app and use your earpiece to roll around the back of the phone, when the earpiece is close to the “Sensor Area” you will be alerted. Use this “Sensor Area” to scan suspicious objects and areas.\n\nYou should place the “Sensor Area” very close to the suspicious objects and areas for detection. Very rarely, when phone is placed closed to hidden spy camera / device, the electromagnetic radiation value will decrease sharply instead of increases. This is due to magnetic interference. Therefore, be attentive as well when electromagnetic radiation value decreases sharply.\n\n4)\tThe app is designed to detect electromagnetic radiation so anything that gives off electromagnetic radiation will be detected. These includes magnetized metal and any other electronics. Therefore, do not be paranoid when the app is alerted, inspect the object and area carefully. There will definitely be a small hole for lens (record video) and / or microphone (record audio).\n\n5)\tSince the app relies on the phone’s hardware for reliability, test and check that the compass and GPS work properly before getting the app.\n\n6)\tThis is a great app to have if you are thinking of searching your area for hidden spy cameras, especially in the toilet cubicle or changing room. The app works best when searching among books, shelves, clothing, sofa cushions and soft toys. \n\nEx. You should use this app to inspect the eyes of teddy bears and other soft toys. Use it to scan all mounted clothes hanging hooks in rooms and toilets too. These are very common objects  to hide hidden spy cameras / devices.\n\n7) If the electromagnetic radiation indicator is stuck, wave your phone in a “figure 8” motion and shake it lightly to reset the hardware in the phone.\n\n8) You can email us from within the app for feedback and support. We will reply within 24 hours.\n\nDownload Electronics Detector and start using it to protect your privacy now!!!",

    "description": "The \"color wheel\", also known as \"color circle\", is a useful color tool. It reflects the hue, saturation and brightness of the color. Through it, you can easily choose the color combination you like. At the same time, you can clearly see the relationship between colors, such as warm colors, cool colors, contrast colors, similar colors, and so on.\n\nIn this application, you pick colors on the color wheel. In particular, you are free to adjust the color wheel, for example to change its color range or structure. You can even define a color wheel with a maximum of 48 segments, 12 levels, and a total of 576 colors.\n\nSaving colors is another major feature of this app. Once you have chosen the color combination you like, you can save it. You collect various colors and build your own color library.\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n【Features】\n∙ Multi-color combination: up to six colors can be combined\n∙ Color collection management: multi-color and solo-color independent collection, support for naming, sorting and copying\n∙ Custom color wheel: define the number of levels, set the range of purity and brightness, etc.\n∙ Sliding color selection: slide directly on the color wheel to select the color\n∙ Color ruler: indicates the color wheel, similar color, contrast color range in which the color is located\n∙ Multiple numerical modes: support HSB, RGB numerical representation, support for integer, decimal representation\n∙ Color card: show the color scheme as a card\n∙ Color data text export: copy to system paste board\n∙ Color card image export: export to album or share to other apps\n\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\n【Contact】\nIf you have any questions, suggestions or comments, please contact us at keepcolors@outlook.com.",

    "description": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 12 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nA part of the Pro Pack (*) add-on, this wonderful new feature allows you to split an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): Pro Pack® is a paid add-on, sold separately from inside the app, as an in-app purchase.",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "“[A] surprising iPhone and Apple Watch bestseller is pushing the boundaries of fiction” - boingboing.net\n“This is the best game on the Apple Watch” - Time.com\n\nLifeline is a playable, branching story of survival against all odds. Using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, you will help Taylor make life or death decisions, and face the consequences together.\n\nAcclaimed writer Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) weaves a gripping interactive story through the aftermath of a crash landing on an alien moon. Taylor is stranded, the rest of the crew are dead or missing, and Taylor’s communicator can only reach you.\n\nLifeline pioneered a new narrative experience enabled by modern devices. This story plays out in real time as Taylor works to stay alive, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Taylor directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.\n\nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and see what happens when you make a different choice. Simple actions can have a profound effect. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n\nLifeline is a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes. Taylor is relying on YOU.\n\nNEW in version 1.8: Stick around after the game for a special story epilogue from Dave Justus. For players who have already finished the game, the Bonus Story becomes available under the game options. Witness the events leading up to Lifeline: Silent Night.\n\nInternet connection not required. No in-app purchases and no ads.\n\n\nPraise for Lifeline:\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“I felt an immediate attachment to a fictional character pinging me from a strange galaxy to my wearable.” - Luke Hopewell, Gizmodo Australia\n\n“[P]laying it on the Apple Watch makes you truly feel like you’re exchanging messages with an astronaut via a futuristic transmitter.” - Michael Andronico, Tom’s Guide\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\n\nLifeline was created by:\nDave Justus\nMars Jokela\nDan Selleck\nColin Liotta\nJason Nowak\nBen “Books” Schwartz",

You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.

You get over 40 high-quality real instruments multi-sampled exclusively for this app. Hundreds of included scales allow you to effortlessly play in any style from rock to classical, whether you are a musical novice or a seasoned professional.\n\n---====---\nJordan Rudess, the world-renowned keyboardist for Dream Theater says:\n\n\"ThumbJam stands at the very top of the overcrowded music app world. The sounds included absolutely rival those found in pro instruments and making music on the app is a total joy. The only problem I have with this app is that I did not make it myself! Luckily, I'm able to work with the developer and offer a few good feature ideas as well as some choice sounds from my personal collection!\"\n---======----\n\nEven if you've only played air guitar, ThumbJam lets you sound like a pro.  Pick an instrument and jam -- with all the scales to choose from you'll never hit a wrong note. The high quality instrument samples will make you sound like you just skipped years of music lessons.\n\nFor the performing musician, this app is awesome for soloing on an instrument you didn't bring along.  Play in any key, any style -- go from a string ensemble to a wailing guitar. ThumbJam was developed and tested by musicians to feel and sound like a real instrument. You'll be surprised at how expressive it can be, make sure to check out the videos and audio at thumbjam.com.\n\nThumbJam makes use of tilt and shake to add vibrato, tremolo, note bends, and volume swells for more realistic and expressive results. It supports up to five (eleven on iPad) simultaneous touches and up to 32 voice polyphony, for each of up to 8 loaded instruments!  Delay and stereo reverb add depth to the sound, and a resonant lowpass filter gives you more tone shaping power. Put on your headphones or plug in to your home stereo to experience some of the highest quality instruments in the App Store, even  after all these years!\n\nBuild your own loops from the ground up or import your favorites and jam from there. Layer as many loops as you want, with different instruments for each. Export your loops as audio files via WiFi.  Copy and paste audio from other apps using AudioCopy/Paste as well the general pasteboard, via email, AudioShare, iTunes Document Sharing, Files, or open directly in another application. Supports Audiobus and InterApp Audio for streaming sound to/from other apps in real-time, including state save/restore with Audiobus 3.\n\nExtensive MIDI input and output support over WiFi or Bluetooth, with any CoreMidi compatible device, or other apps on the same iOS device with virtual MIDI. Now also supports Ableton Link for tight sync between apps on the same network. Supports MPE input and output (and did so before it was even a thing)!\n\nNew powerful arpeggiator feature lets you play patterns with perfect time sync, from the screen or via MIDI control.\n\nThe app includes a huge variety of scales, from western to eastern. Save your favorites for quick access, or create your own in-app. You can even import new scales in the Scala format for complete flexibility.\n\nYou can also record your own multi-sampled instruments using a built-in or attached microphone, or from file import.  \n\nIncluded instruments:\n  \n  + Cello, Violin, Viola\n  + Upright Bass (plucked and bowed)\n  + Several drumkits\n  + Darabukka\n  + Djembe\n  + Electric Guitar\n  + Electric Bass\n  + Trumpet\n  + Trombone\n  + Tenor Sax\n  + Flute\n  + Low Whistle\n  + Acoustic Guitar\n  + Hammered Dulcimer\n  + Mandolin\n  + Cittern\n  + Grand Piano\n  + Drawbar Organ (2 types)\n  + Rhodes\n  + Pipe Organ\n  + Synth Strings\n  + Synth Choir\n  + Theremin\n  + Sawtooth Waveform\n  + Sine Waveform\n  + Triangle Waveform\nAnd from Jordan Rudess:\n  + JR Zendrix\n  + JR Smooth Steel \n\nMany more for immediate FREE download in the app including several drumkits, Mellotron, basses, banjo, tabla, ukelele, guitars and more!

But it's even much better: assign your favorite iPhone contacts to positions (1-50) for quick dialing (or FaceTime), emailing, or texting (SMS/iMessage or WhatsApp)! The assigned contacts will be shown by photo or name (or by nickname) on a rotatable 3D area and can be called with a single tap. \n\n• QUICK AND EASY\n1x tap to call contact.\n2x tap to text (SMS/iMessage).\n3x tap to WhatsApp.\n4x tap to email. \n5x tap to FaceTime.\nOr simply do a long press on a contact and select the corresponding action.\n\n• NO NUMBERS REQUIRED\nThis app reuses the contacts already stored on your iPhone, so that you do not have to enter phone numbers or email addresses again! Just assign a contact to a position and everything works automatically like a charm! If you change your contacts later, the app will automatically use the new data!\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Due to this feature, Quick Fav Dial needs access to your contacts! If you don't grant access on the first startup, the app will not work properly and permanently forget all assignments after restart (you can resolve this issue in the Privacy settings of your iPhone later)!\n\n• 3D SCROLLING \nThe horizontal 3D scrolling enables fast horizontal browsing through the positions.\n\n• COLOR THEMES/DESIGNS\nThe app supports many different designs that enable to custom the display to your needs. \n\n• DARK MODE SUPPORT\n\n• MORE THEN 50 POSITIONS\nMore than fifty positions give enough space to visually group together related contacts (e.g., family, friends, colleagues, etc. in an own spatial area) and to quickly find frequently used contacts!\n\n• MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENTS \nWhen you assign a contact to a position the app automatically stores the first phone number and first email address, if available. If you want to use a different number or email address, you have two options: either enable \"manual field selection\" in Settings or assign the same contact to another position, then the app will ask which number/email address to use. With manual field selection enabled the app also allows to use email addresses for texting instead of the phone number, which will enable iMessage instead of common SMS.",
