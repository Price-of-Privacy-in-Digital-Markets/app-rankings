    "description": "AIM OF GAME: passing into the high performance state (HPS). The state is characterized by higher brain activity (in comparison with ordinary state). It helps to take decisions, get answers to difficult questions, find ways out of problem situations and maybe even drastically change the attitude to such situations.\nIn different parts of the screen in random way you can see name of word – color name of the word “CLAP”. The color of the word is selected in random way too. You need to say the color (not the written word) and clap your hands, if you see the word “CLAP”.\n\n*** GAME SETTINGS ***\nIn the game settings you can choose:\n• 9 colors for the game: blue, green, red, brown, orange, pink, purple, yellow, turquoise.\n• Percentage of color matching and color name.\n• The style of writing words.\n• The percentage of claps for the game, to consider or not to take into account the position of the palms when clapping.\n• The location of the text on the screen: random or at the center.\n• Music and sounds during the game and at its end.\n\nBesides that you can select the language for the color names:\nEnglish, Russian, German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Kazakh, Arabic, Hebrew, Polish, Czech, Romanian, Hungarian, Serbian, Estonian, Latvian, Lithuanian, Georgian, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Turkish, Greek, Albanian, Croatian, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Norwegian, Bosnian, Bulgarian , Macedonian, Slovak, Slovenian, Irish, Icelandic, Thai, Filipino, Vietnamese, Japanese, Korean, Chinese\n\n*** GAME RULES ***\n\nGAME START\nThink about a problem situation: imagine it, remember the sounds, body position, feel it, write down. Associate yourself with the problem situation or task as much as possible.\n\nPASSING TO GAME\nChange the body position, breath, shake the shoulders. And immediately start the game.\n\nGAME ITSELF\nSelect the speed of the game that it would difficult and interesting enough for you, that the game would be with ardour.\nSelect the time of game: minimal 2 minutes, it is recommended about 10-15 minutes.\nRun the game.\nOn the screen you can see a word in any color with the name of a random color or the word “clap”. Sometimes the color name and the reflected color can coincide, sometimes not. You should say the color regardless of the written word. At the same time if the word “clap’ is shown you need to clap your hands.\n\nTo complicate the game it is possible in the settings:\n1. To select additional colors.\n2. Set the option of different words for the clap. To clap the hands in the way that left or right palm is on top at the clap.\n3. To show the directions where the word appeared by hands.\n\nFINAL PART\nReturn to the context of the task. Maybe you won’t be able to do it immediately. You should apply every effort for it. It’s important.\nRealize the task one more time. Pay attention to changes of your attitude to the task.\n\nDO YOU KNOW THAT\nThe game is one of the games of NLP New Code (neuro-linguistic programming), that give even and safe load for brain and help to enter the high performance state. It allows to put a different perspective on the world for some time.\nIt is recommended to play regularly – 2-3 times a week.\nIn this game the Stroop effect is used (the research of this effect is published in 1935) – the delay of reaction to the reading of the word if this word means one color but is written in another one.\n\nIf you have some problems, please, write to me: \nSettings -> About App -> Write or iosdev.radchenko@gmail.com",

Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots.",

There’s also a place to jot down your notes, and a deadline to keep you on schedule.\n\n• Your Areas\nCreate an Area for each sphere of your life, such as Work, Family, Finance, and so on.

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

An instrument that is both pitch fluid, and helps the performer precisely reach desired musical pitches in any temperament.  \n\nGeoShred is an award-winning,  fluidly expressive musical instrument that runs on multi-touch devices. \n\nIt has a performance surface with “almost magic” pitch rounding algorithms which is coupled with a model of the physics of several types of musical instruments, support for AUv3, MIDI In/Out, MPE, and 3D Touch.  It’s a fusion of Jordan Rudess’ performance concepts and a powerful, modeled guitar/effects based on the Physical Modeling research of Dr. Julius O. Smith III of Stanford/CCRMA.  And, GeoShred's expressive control can be used with other synthesizers.\n\nTens of thousands of artists in 48 countries perform GeoShred with 30% of those users in India. \n\nGeoShred is the Gold Medal Winner of the 2019 Denny Award, winner of a 2019 Guthman New Musical Instrument Award, and winner of the 2017 Electronic Musician Editor's Choice Award as \"one of the most innovative, groundbreaking products to emerge in the past twelve months\".\n\n\nGeoShred Pro Version 5 Features include:\n\n• In-App-Purchases (IAP) for 6 different GeoSWAM instruments, GeoViolin, GeoFlute, GeoTenoSax, GeoCello, GeoClarinet, and GeoOboe \n• A fluidly expressive playing surface + a Physically modeled guitar\n• Au3 plugin support on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater \n• Intelligent pitch rounding\n• A diatonic keyboard where every key on the screen is in the scale.\n• MIDI IN/OUT and MPE support\n• MIDI control using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, virtual MIDI and all digital interfaces \n• MIDI configuration presets\n• 3D touch on iPhones that support 3D touch\n• Customizable control surface can be mapped to physical MIDI controls\n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus support.\n• Backing tracks\n• Multiple Modeled effects\n• Modeled feedback and VCF effects\n• Echo, a unique looper and multi-tap echo \n• Finger vibrato, slide and fret scraping\n• Unique mono mode using intervals of multiple strings. \n• Built-in Arpeggiator\n• Alternative tunings and temperaments\n• Support for world scales and temperaments including Indian Ragas, Arabic and Balinese scales. \n• Easily share presets with friends\n\n---\n \nPraise for the GeoShred family of apps: \n\n“GeoShred is brilliant- it’s a real instrument.” – Eddie Jobson\n\n“A fantastic new invention which is going to revolutionize the way music is played, expressed and learned! “GeoShred” is one of the foremost best musical inventions I’ve had the pleasure to experience in recent years. Definitely 5 stars out of 5! GIGANTASTIVISSIMO…..R…A…Z !!!!!” – Patrick Moraz\n\n“That’s just nuts. You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.  It would mean a lot to us if you could leave your positive review on the App Store and If you have any questions about GeoShred we would love to hear from you at our support email address: support@moforte.com \n\n---\n\nMinimum Requirements:  iOS 11.4 or better is required for AUv3, iCloud and GeoSWAM instruments.\n***Note: The GeoSWAM instruments can ONLY be performed from the GeoShred keyboard or MPE controllers.\n***Note: Unfortunately, due to App Store limitations, previously purchased instrument IAPs can not be applied to a purchase of the collection IAP.",

    "description": "Hydra offers innovative photo capture technology, and lets you take beautiful pictures even in the most difficult lighting conditions, which makes it a great companion to iOS Camera app.\n\n“The Hydra app from Belgian company Creaceed is one of the more interesting iOS camera apps we have seen in the recent past.”\n— DPReview\n\n“Hydra is for people who enjoy iPhone photography at a higher and more rewarding level.”\n— David Robinson (iPhonographer)\n\n\"Hydra has the particularity of offering original features, which are missing from many competing apps.\"\n— iPhon.fr\n\nHydra captures more light by merging up to 60 frames to make a single high-quality picture (less noise, more highlights/shadows) on iPhone and iPad. Hydra also goes beyond the 8- or 12-megapixel sensor limit, with up to 32-megapixel high-resolution images. It uses the latest evolutions of iPhone and iPad camera hardware, as well as the latest camera APIs and GPU rendering technologies.\n\nHydra provides 5 specific capture modes: HDR, Video-HDR, Lo-Light, Zoom, and Hi-res modes. \n\n• Hydra's High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is based on an alternate method that captures up to 20 images and that is made to handle even the most difficult lighting conditions. \n• Video-HDR uses single-image tone mapping and device-specific sensor mode to create stunning videos. \n• Lo-Light mode removes sensor noise by merging together multiple images and amplifying light by a factor of 10 to provide a better image quality.\n• Zoom mode uses real-time, super-resolution technique to recreate missing pixels from hand motion, producing 2x, 4x and 8x (telephoto lens) scale factors with more details than the standard digital zooming technique(*).\n• Hi-res mode produces up to 32MP images from the regular 8 or 12MP camera sensor, providing finer details in captured image(*).\n• Hydra supports the telephoto & front cameras respectively in Zoom and Lo-Light/HDR modes to shoot portraits & selfies.\n• Camera support: ultra wide, wide, telephoto, and front facing.\n\nHydra also features a photo gallery for reviewing images and their metadata, directly linked with built-in iOS photo album, thus avoiding duplicates and allowing to flag as favorites.\n\n(*) recommended for static scenes or distant scenery. Rendering artifacts can occur for scenes with parallax and for moving subjects.",

Explore the colorful and electrifying world of science and meet all 118 of the elements from the periodic table. \n\nDiscover elements by experimenting with the lab tools! \n\n* Take your element for a spin in the centrifuge.\n* Warm them up in the Bunsen burner. \n* Put the element on ice with the cooling agent! \n* Add a drop or two of mysterious liquids from the test tubes.\n* Change their voltage and make them magnetic with the oscilloscope.\n\nEach element has it's own personality. In Toca Lab: Elements, what does Neon sound like? Is Gold heavy or light? Is Nitrogen squishy or hard? Explore, inspect, and study each one and let us know! Can you find all 118? \n\nThe time has come, future scientists, to head into the lab to explore and discover. Put on your lab coat and protective eye gear because things are about to get experimental!\n\nToca Lab: Elements is a place for playing and having fun, and with it we hope to inspire kids to explore science.

    "description": "Pregnant? This is for YOU!\nOur leading app allows you to use just your iPhone microphone to record and share your baby’s sounds. It is the best-in-class, has excellent reviews, is super simple and safe to use. \n\n\"It took some time and patience... but I found it... thank you for creating this cheap, awesome technology to use at home.\" - Niki\n\nCategory #1 in the UK and 101 other countries. Here's why...\n\nDeveloped by parents like you (with expertise in sound engineering and app development) who wanted a trustworthy, safe and easy-to-use way to record our baby's heartbeat and other sounds - and keep a record of a quality that we hadn't been able to find before in other apps. It has been extensively tested on expectant mothers.\n\n\"I was skeptical at first but you can really hear the heart beat! Great app! Worth it.\" - Legretta \n\n**** But honestly, does it actually work?? ****\nYes. We've sound-engineered ways to attempt to isolate the baby's sounds and using an advanced algorithm, amplify them making them easier to detect and hear.\n\nIt takes time, technique and patience and depends on the position and number of weeks of your baby so you'll need to stick with it.\n\nWhen you do, our results are excellent. Results are best between 27-40 weeks as your baby is bigger and stronger. \n\nWe constantly improve our extensive tutorial and techniques to handhold you through - we even have a support group on Facebook so you can get help.\n\nWe want you to be happy with HMB and getting results can sometimes be difficult.  If you are struggling DO contact us via support. We want to help you!\n\nGIFT THIS APP: Click the “Buy App” arrow on the iTunes® App Store\n\n\nFAQs\n\n**** No Accessories Required ****\nWe use the internal microphone from your phone to attempt to listen and record your baby heartbeat.\n\n**** Works Beautifully From 27 Weeks ****\nIt is possible (but less likely) to hear from as early as 16-20 weeks, best results are most often achieved as the baby gets larger.\n\n**** How It Works ****\n1. Hear My Baby, has been precisely engineered to listen to abdominal sounds, then record and amplify them. \n2. It works best when baby is head down and their back is facing forwards.\n3. Remove the case, be in a very quiet room and focus on your lower abdomen. Listen then Tap record.\n4. Our simple recording management helps you to keep a record of your special moment\n5. Take a selfie if you wish and share \n6. We'll walk you through exactly how to get the best results\n\n**** Easy Share Feature ****\nSharing is awesome you can opt to share via Facebook, Whats App, Instagram or email.\n\n**** We Care About Your Privacy ****\nWe take your privacy and special moment seriously. You decide who sees or hears it and can delete it at any time.\n\n**** Before you start... ****\nYou DO need to carefully follow the instructions for HMB to work. A quiet room is critical for results as the mic is super sensitive in the heartbeat range.   HMB doesn't fake the baby heartbeat or other sounds :) \n\nPlease Note: results are normally superb, however the recording may not work if your placenta is at the front of the tummy or the baby is in the wrong position.\n\n**** Supported Phones ****\nX, Xs, 11, 11 Pro, 8, 7, 7+, SE, 6s, 6s+, 6, 6+ 5c, 5s & 5. We don't support iPad.\n\n**** Worried about safety? We are too! ***\nHMB is safe but to be extra sure DO switch your iPhone to airplane mode. This is a precaution and automatically stops all cellular transmissions.\n\n**** Is it a substitute for medical devices/support? ****\nNo - we wouldn't wish to claim otherwise. Under no circumstances is HMB a substitute for medical support - if you don't get a result it doesn't mean anything is wrong with your baby :)- Consult your doctor for any advice. We are NOT approved by the FDA or any other medical authority. This is not a medical device. \n\nPlease do check our T&Cs before downloading.\n\nFor results examples: www.facebook.com/hearmybaby\nwww.instagram.com/hearmybabyapp",

The app supports 2 accurately tuned/synthesised, tanpuras each with 6 strings and other advanced controls, all on a single page.\n\nI am a signal processing engineer by profession and Hindustani classical singer by passion. I have developed this app after rigorous analysis of the resonance of instrument. Connect your device to good speakers and enjoy the sound in high fidelity. Ideally place the speakers at least 3 to 4 feet away for the best effect.\n\nThis version contains several digitized tanpura profiles. Use them and adjust the tempo/pluck-style to get the best combination that suits your taste. Two full octaves are now supported. Use the higher pitches with caution as they may sound  little shrill and are suitable for use only with instruments.\n\n * About Bheema Tanpura  *\n\n\"This application takes its name from one of the greatest hindustani classical singers of our times, Pt Bhimsen Joshi, the maestro of Kiraana School of North-Indian classical music.

    "description": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

With flowing brush strokes and thickly painted texture, Van Gogh made his sunflowers immortal; with harmonious movement of color, contrast, and form, Monet made his lily pond a celebrity. It took their genius, lifetimes of practice, and navigating the riot of their senses, but these extraordinary artists took what they saw and felt in the petals and leaves and transferred their impressions onto canvasses full of beauty, mood, and meaning. \n\nLucky you, 21st century iPhone-wielding seer and lover of beauty—you have Impresso. With the same enduring attention to detail, light, color, and texure, Impresso transforms your photos into multi-textured, stroke-filled Impressionist masterpieces. And keen eyes will love how Impresso maintains the balance of your piece! The result—captivating, print-worthy paintings brimming with passion, life, and beauty. \n\nIMPRESSIONISM STYLES\nAlla Prima—uses a small brush inside an already placed detail ellipse tool for up-close or full-length portraits and still lifes. Included with this beautiful paint style is a library of artistic finishes to fill the painting with light and color\n\nEn Plein Air—creates a stroke-filled landscape using one of the eight color palettes created by famous impressionist artists.\n\n\nFEATURES \nOne-touch settings automatically transform photos into paintings using one of many paint styles.\n\nOne-of-a-kind ellipse detail tool renders small brush strokes inside the placed area. A single ellipse can be used for a face or body; or use two or more for the eyes, hands or other objects.\n\nCanvas or Linen texturing—gives realism to brushed paint. Control over texture turns strength down for printing to canvas.\n\nArtista Impresso is a professional painting app created for photographers and artists of all skill levels!\n\n\nINCLUDES\n• Three easy to change brush stroke styles\n• Control over detail ellipse tool, canvas strength, artistic finish and painted edge\n• Canvas and linen texture\n• 8 Impressionist palette styles\n• 40 One-touch paint styles\n• 70 Artistic finishes\n\n\nEVERY JIXIPIX PRODUCT FEATURES\n•\tSupport for high resolution images and output\n•\tMultiple Undo\n•\tRandomize Button\n•\tQuick Previewing\n•\tCustomizable Styles\n•\tSuperior customer service\nContact us any time we are committed to your long-term satisfaction!\n\n________________________________________________________\n\nJixiPix turns any photo into a masterpiece. \nThe only requirement is art appreciation—we will take care of the rest!\n________________________________________________________\n\nJixiPix.Com\nCreative Tools for Creative Types\nPhotography | Graphic | Artistic Apps",

    "description": "The Rewriters app offers walking tours through various neighbourhoods of Rotterdam, guiding you to the most interesting and beautiful street art pieces in the city. These walks take about an hour and a half and show you the many surprising sides of Europe’s main port city. All tours are updated multiple times per year, to keep you up to date regarding the latest developments in Rotterdam street art. Updates of the routes are always provided for free.\n\nRewriters gives you background information on each of the murals, shows you the newest murals to appear in the city, and informs you about notable works that have disappeared throughout the years. The information is available in Dutch and English, in spoken and written form. Each route can be saved offline, so you can enjoy your guided tours without using an internet connection and data usage.\n\nBesides that, the app also keeps you up to date about the latest street art news. New art projects being developed, in-depth interviews with (inter)nationally renowned artists and the latest facts about festivals like POW! WOW! Rotterdam you can find under the ‘Latest News’ tab in the app. Do you have hot tips for our editors? Scroll down below in the main menu and share them with us!\n\nDon’t want to walk the whole tour? No problem. You can start at any point in Rotterdam. The app will locate the nearest artwork, and start the tour from there.\n\nPlease note: the app makes use of your GPS location. This may lower your phone’s battery more quickly than usual. To save battery life, we advise you to save the desired tour for offline use beforehand, and lower the brightness of your screen during use.\n\nOTHER MEDIA TALKING ABOUT REWRITERS:\n\n“If street art is your thing, Rotterdam’s scene is exploding. (…) The app Rewriters can direct you on a self-guided street-art tour that begins at the eye-popping new Rotterdam Centraal train station.”\n\n—Vogue, February 23, 2017\n\n“The app has a map and background information in text and audio and also shows the locations of notable graffiti that has disappeared.”\n\n—The New York Times, May 15, 2016\n\n“The streets of Rotterdam are becoming a vibrant open air gallery.”\n\n—Mass Appeal, May 12, 2016",

Using Shop3D smart shopping list categories\nManage your Shopping List in a refreshing new way; by quickly switching order between What, Where, Who.\n\nDo you find that when you are out around the shops that you are either jumping around the shops/aisles, or jumping around your shopping list?\nWouldn't it be easy if your list adjusted it's order automatically depending on where you are going?\nShop3D has the answer!\n\nShop3D is a simple and snappy way to manage a shopping list.\nBy quickly switching between 3 views, you can focus on getting the job done.\n\nWhy “3D”?\n3 ways to view your list;-\n1. When you add items to your shopping list, you are probably thinking at a “what category” level  …baking  …meats  …household  …vegetables.\n2. But when you go shopping, you head to  “where”  the items are …butcher  …pharmacy  … supermarket\n3. You also have a custom view, which could be “who” the items are for …kids   …pets   …baby.  OR you may want to change this field to another criteria, for example “Location” within a store …row1  …row2  …row3 \n\nShop3D allows quick and fluid changing between these different contexts, and MUCH more…\n\n* Multiple shopping lists\n* Lists can be grouped (e.g. Recipes/Shopping lists)\n* Lists have a note section (e.g. Recipe)\n* All shopping lists save their own status (selections/checked/remaining)\n* Many colour themes + Follow iOS 13 system Dark/Light appearance\n* “Disable Lock Screen” option so that you phone stays on during your shop.\n* iPhone and iPad optimised layouts \n* iCloud Sync (create your list at home on the iPad, go shopping with your iPhone)\n* Swipe to copy, swipe to delete items & lists\n* Dynamic search in all areas\n* Share PDF report of all items, or a single shopping list/recipe - portrait/landscape/condensed print options (and shop the old fashion way!)\n* Backup entire items list to file + restore\n* Share items list to another user running Shop3D\n* Over 200 items pre-loaded (optional).  Add more of your own items, edit pre-loaded items\n* Detailed item editing: name, grouping (What/Where/Who - the killer feature!), and optionally brand, quantity, cost, notes\n* Grouping lists (What/Where/Who) can be freely created/edited/deleted\n* Reset complete Database\n* End Shop reset options;-\n  - REPEAT SHOP - reset checklist & keep Selections\n  - UNSELECT CHECKED - starts your next shop with just the items you missed\n  - UNSELECT ALL - Reset selections (start again)\n* Budget feature:  Each item can have a cost, and there is an option in shopping list to display costs/calculate your shopping totals (with category sub-totals)\n* Progress bar - visually see how far through your list",

Playing this game will challenge and improve all of these.\n\nEach game begins by presenting you with a random collection of zodiac signs. After 10 seconds, the signs are covered, and you have to touch where each one is located when its prompt appears.\n\nThe game has 5 levels. The lowest level displays 3 zodiac signs, and the highest displays all 12. To move to the next level, you have to uncover each sign without making any mistakes.\n\nFor each level, the game keeps track of how many attempts you have made so far.\n\nDon't get discouraged! Your scores in this game will improve with practice. Still, you are unlikely to complete the highest level, no matter how long you try. Very few people are able to memorise 12 symbols in only 10 seconds.",

    "description": "Featured in LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\n\nDa Vinci Eye is the #1 essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

Enjoy the show on your big screen.\n\nWith Video & TV Cast you can browse through the web and stream any video you want on your Amazon Fire TV (movies, tv shows, sports, music and more). Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.",

    "description": "Tala Keeper is a versatile visual programmable metronome designed to help internalize the flow of musical time. Tala Keeper's bouncing ball not only indicates beats but also presents the flow of time between beats. To program Tala Keeper, simply tap the pads to indicate the desired bounce positions. The iPad display is useful in studio sessions.\n\nTala Keeper is applicable to many world music genres and comes with some features tailored for the scenarios that turn up in Carnatic music - South Indian Classical music. Keep time with a periodic “tala” pattern when practicing melodies or reverse the role and play a rhythmically complex pattern (such as pallavi trikalam and nadai changes) while the student plays the tala or follows along. Its beat visualization and sonification options provide many intermediate stepping stones that help advance and strengthen a student’s rhythmic facility. \n\nTIP - Visit http://talakeeper.org/talas.html for a free web-based tool to play the 35 systematic talas of Carnatic music. Tala Keeper is not limited to these patterns and you can create your own which you can share with others too. A free online player is available at http://talakeeper.org/tk3 for playing patterns composed on Tala Keeper.\n\nFOR THE BEGINNER MUSIC STUDENT\n\nTala Keeper can help introduce you to the flow of time in simple patterns such as meditative chants. Follow the beats by waving your hands or aligning your breathing to the bouncing ball. Programming patterns by tapping the pads is itself instructive for beginners.\n\nFOR THE ADVANCED STUDENT/MUSICIAN\n\nProgram compound patterns featuring mixtures of nadais and speeds into Tala Keeper and practice along. Use it to keep time during very slow speeds of pallavis so that you are free to experiment with melodic expression. Program the timing of the syllables of a niraval and practice along with it to achieve confidence and expression in your improvisation. Master tisra, kanda and misra nadais by creating your own exercises to shift from one to another for practice.\n\nPROGRAM FEATURES\n\n• A bouncing ball precisely indicates beats while providing a feel for the time passing between beats.\n\n• Beat count display (optional, up to 180bpm).\n\n• MUTE button. You read it right! You can use Tala Keeper on an iPad within a studio session to coordinate musicians, either with the sound muted or piped to AirPlay.\n\n• Easy pattern programming. Just tap out the pattern you want on the pads at the bottom of the screen. The pads correspond to the ball's bounce locations.\n\n• Easy tempo setting. Pinch with two fingers, pan or tap the main screen to set the tempo. Wide tempo range of 15-960bpm. \n\n• Zen mode - rest your iPhone or iPad on a stationary surface during practice and the controls will be automatically hidden to give a clean view. The controls return the moment you pick up your device.\n\n• Arbitrary pattern subdivisions. For Carnatic musicians, set \"kalai\" and \"nadai\" with just a few taps. For example, to set \"kalai\" to \"4 kalai\", tap \"×÷\" to bring up the interface, tap the centre pad 4 times and tap \"×\". Explore wild cross rhythms like 5 against 7.\n\n• Combine patterns by concatenating them ... even if they have different nadais.\n\n• Elephant memory. Store patterns you're working on either in handy memory buttons or by name in Tala Keeper's pattern database. \n\n• Share patterns you create with your friends by email or via social networks. They can play your patterns at http://talakeeper.org/tk3 even if they don't have Tala Keeper. (Safari and Chrome browsers are supported).\n\n• Common Carnatic talas are preloaded in the database as examples. Programming talas is so simple you won't even need these!\n\n• Shake the iPhone or iPod touch to revert to the previous pattern if you made a mistake while tapping.",
