Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength.

    "description": "> Find the ElectroMagnetic Fields around you in seconds.\n> Organize your life away from the EMF risk zones.\n\nCheck out the areas where you work (desk, meeting rooms), where you sleep (bed), where you relax (couch, living room) and find the levels of EMF you are exposed to. \nAlso use the app to measure the fields emitted by your appliances (computer, fridge, speaker, phone...)\n\nNo need to buy expensive equipment. \nThe EMF Detector app on your phone will help you detect the EMF risk zones.\nFeel free to re-organize your home in order to limit lengthy exposure to high EMF zones.\n\nSo download now and improve your well-being!\n\n\nMORE INFORMATION\n\n=> What are Electro-Magnetic Fields?\nElectro-Magnetic Fields are everywhere around us, in everything that is electric or electronic. Think about computers, phones, power lines, cellular towers, lights, Wi-Fi, Smart TVs… All these items emit low-frequency radiations around them. \nThese Electro Magnetic Radiations can interfere with other electronic items. That is why you can sometimes see glitches on a TV or distortion in sound or music. \nOur world will continue to showcase incremental interconnection with appliances that emit EMF. These tools have provided an enormous range of benefits for humans. But it is necessary to keep in mind all impacts on well being.\n\n=> Why should I care?\nNumerous studies have shown impacts on biological creatures. There are still discussions around the seriousness of the harm it could cause to human beings though. Our bodies are a complex network of cells, brains, and matter that are sensitive to the outside world in ways we do not fully understand yet. \nResearch seems to indicate impacts on well being, disturbing sleep cycles and affecting our immune system. Globally it could contribute to numerous health problems. As a result, cautionary behavior is recommended for all and especially for people looking to improve their well being.\n\n=> What can I do?\nUse this application to detect EMF exposure around you. Walk around your house with the app and spot the locations with high radiations. \nMake sure to limit the time spent next to these zones, especially during extended periods like during sleep. \nSo place your couch, your bed and your sofa away from these spots. Check the emission levels around places where you spent a lot of time: your kitchen, living room, bedroom. Check your laptop, TV, alarm clock, cell phones, Wi-Fi, air conditioner…\nBut also measure exposure outside your home: where you work, where you practice sport. Also, limit exposure to cell towers that emit a high level of EMF.\n\nNote: \n- This app will not work on an iPod Touch since it does not have a compass hardware.\n- This app does not guarantee completely exact measures as other fields can interfere with the compass inside your phone, which is used to detect the fields.",

Set your Hatch timer from 5 to 120 minutes \n2. Stay focused without leaving the app \n3. Enter the goal or other information for this session \n4. Hatch your new friend \n\n-How it Works iPad-\n1. Set your Hatch timer from 5 to 120 minutes \n2. You may let the timer run in the background \n3. Complete your task \n4. Hatch your new friend \n\nParents & Teachers: \nHatch utilizes positive behavioral reinforcement as a way to reward students for staying focused and completing tasks. We recommend starting off with shorter sessions, 5-10 minutes, and gradually increasing the focus sessions as your child or student becomes accustomed to staying focused for longer periods of time without interruption.\n\nPro Tip: Create a family or class focus group. Give your group a fun name and compete to see who can log the most focus minutes in the family. Set your Hatch timer for 25-30 minutes at night and let everyone in the family curl up with their favorite book and come together when it’s time to see what everyone has hatched. \n\nEndorsed by Order out of Chaos (@orderoutofchaos) as a tool to help students with ADHD or those who are otherwise easily distracted",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

    "description": "This unique app brings the simple and efficient speed dialing feature of old mobile phones to your iPhone! But it's even much better: assign your favorite iPhone contacts to positions (1-50) for quick dialing (or FaceTime), emailing, or texting (SMS/iMessage or WhatsApp)! The assigned contacts will be shown by photo or name (or by nickname) on a rotatable 3D area and can be called with a single tap. \n\n• QUICK AND EASY\n1x tap to call contact.\n2x tap to text (SMS/iMessage).\n3x tap to WhatsApp.\n4x tap to email. \n5x tap to FaceTime.\nOr simply do a long press on a contact and select the corresponding action.\n\n• NO NUMBERS REQUIRED\nThis app reuses the contacts already stored on your iPhone, so that you do not have to enter phone numbers or email addresses again! Just assign a contact to a position and everything works automatically like a charm! If you change your contacts later, the app will automatically use the new data!\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Due to this feature, Quick Fav Dial needs access to your contacts! If you don't grant access on the first startup, the app will not work properly and permanently forget all assignments after restart (you can resolve this issue in the Privacy settings of your iPhone later)!\n\n• 3D SCROLLING \nThe horizontal 3D scrolling enables fast horizontal browsing through the positions.\n\n• COLOR THEMES/DESIGNS\nThe app supports many different designs that enable to custom the display to your needs. \n\n• DARK MODE SUPPORT\n\n• MORE THEN 50 POSITIONS\nMore than fifty positions give enough space to visually group together related contacts (e.g., family, friends, colleagues, etc. in an own spatial area) and to quickly find frequently used contacts!\n\n• MULTIPLE ASSIGNMENTS \nWhen you assign a contact to a position the app automatically stores the first phone number and first email address, if available. If you want to use a different number or email address, you have two options: either enable \"manual field selection\" in Settings or assign the same contact to another position, then the app will ask which number/email address to use. With manual field selection enabled the app also allows to use email addresses for texting instead of the phone number, which will enable iMessage instead of common SMS.",

Each vocab flashcard has a silly cartoon, a clear definition of the word with an example sentence, and a memorable mnemonic to make it easier to remember the word. \n\nHere's a mnemonic example so you know what I'm talking about: \"prodigal\" means \"wasteful\". The prodigal Prada gal spent $1500 on a pair of Prada boots. Get it? :)\n\nThe app's smart spaced repetition system shows you words when you need to review them to make your GRE vocabulary studying more efficient and effective.

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

The app supports 2 accurately tuned/synthesised, tanpuras each with 6 strings and other advanced controls, all on a single page.\n\nI am a signal processing engineer by profession and Hindustani classical singer by passion. I have developed this app after rigorous analysis of the resonance of instrument. Connect your device to good speakers and enjoy the sound in high fidelity. Ideally place the speakers at least 3 to 4 feet away for the best effect.\n\nThis version contains several digitized tanpura profiles. Use them and adjust the tempo/pluck-style to get the best combination that suits your taste. Two full octaves are now supported. Use the higher pitches with caution as they may sound  little shrill and are suitable for use only with instruments.\n\n * About Bheema Tanpura  *\n\n\"This application takes its name from one of the greatest hindustani classical singers of our times, Pt Bhimsen Joshi, the maestro of Kiraana School of North-Indian classical music.

When you add a document, it is scanned in the background, so when you search, results are instant. And as well as searching within a document, you can search across all your documents at once.\n\nIt’s also a great PDF viewer with a very natural style of navigation. It snaps to page boundaries, yet it’s easy to flick past them. Zooming is straightforward by pinching, or you can double-tap a region of text to zoom to fit. You can easily jump to any part of the document using the scrub bar. And everything is lightning-fast, even on large documents.\n\nYou can easily get your documents into QuickSearch from other apps on your iPad or iPhone that support the \"Open In...\" function, such as Mail, Safari, or Dropbox. You can also use iTunes File Sharing to transfer documents to and from your Mac or PC. Full step-by-step instructions are included.",

    "description": "From SmartAppsforKids.com: \"In my opinion, the full version is a must-have for parents of children working on increasing expressive vocabulary, as well as the therapists and teachers who support their learning. First Phrases is creative, utilizes the iPad’s features in effective ways, and is engaging for young children. Highly recommended.\"\n\nThis interactive, beautifully illustrated and animated app for the iPHONE is perfect for the toddler or speech-delayed child who is learning how to put two or three words together or any child who is learning basic English phrases. It provides many opportunities to both hear (receptive), see, and say/record (expressive) 72 different verb + noun combinations, such as: eat the carrot, blow the bubble, ride the bike, throw the ball, sleep on the bed, put away the toys, and more. Check out our YouTube video for a demonstration of this app (iPad version) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXw4WPlrmwg\n\nWith  different characters performing them, there are 456 possible animations so your child will never be bored! \n\n\nPLEASE NOTE: THIS IS A HUGE APP DUE TO THE MANY ANIMATIONS, PICTURES AND VOICE RECORDINGS CONTAINED IN IT. IT SHOULD BE DOWNLOADED THROUGH A DIRECT OR WI-FI CONNECTION. DOWNLOADING IT VIA A PHONE CONNECTION MAY RESULT IN AN INCOMPLETE INSTALLATION, WHICH MEANS IT WILL NOT WORK RIGHT. \n\nThere are 17 simple verbs such as drink, eat, wash, and 12 verb + preposition forms such as jump on, take off or turn on. Each verb form is paired with various nouns to make a logical phrase. It is also a great way to teach the article “the” in a meaningful phrase context. In addition, it includes user settings for up to 15 children, making it an excellent choice for professional use by a speech-language pathologist or special needs classroom at a fraction of the cost of traditional educational software, with no additional “professional” version fees.\n\nHow you play: Tell the cute animals what to do! By touching the illustrated parts of the phrases in order (verb+ object forms: “eat the carrot”) the child hears the pre-recorded spoken phrase modeled. The user has the option to repeat this action once, twice or three times in the settings for maximum auditory input.\n\nThe child then watches the animal of their choice (bear, mouse or cat) perform the command to help associate the words with their meaning. Now it’s the child’s turn to say it and tell the animal what to do! Touch the microphone and record, listen again, and watch the animal follow your direction. Use the optional visual support to help your child remember what to say!\n\nThis format is especially powerful for children with speech delays and autism spectrum disorders who need strong visual support with as little background clutter as possible, and for use in speech therapy sessions. The format also is a terrific way to support early literacy for left to right orientation, reading (with text on feature) and word boundaries. Options include text on/text off, recording feature on/off, girl or boy voice models, presentation of the phrase in 3 segments (verb + the + object) or 2 segments (verb + the object).\n\nPRIVACY POLICY: We do NOT collect personal data from our users and have no ads! Personal data regarding user performance on the tasks on this app are self-contained and not transmitted in any way. This app does include an in-app purchase.\n\nDeveloped by noted speech-language pathologist and author of Childhood Speech, Language & Listening Problems: What Every Parent Should Know, Patti Hamaguchi, M.A., CCC-SLP.\n\nTo find out more about this app and our other upcoming projects, visit our website: www.hamaguchiapps.com",

    "description": "The first app dedicated to training men how to last longer in bed, through two simple exercises you can do anywhere!\n\nStamena trains your “PC muscle,” which makes it easy to stop yourself ejaculating, delays the onset of ejaculation, and even lets you have non-ejaculatory orgasms!\n\nOther kegel apps, built for women, ignore the most important exercise for male sexual stamina: the reverse kegel! \n\nReverse kegels train your PC muscles to relax, making sure that you can slow yourself down during sex. Combine that with regular kegels and you'll reach ejaculation slower, and be able to stop yourself at the last minute when you get there.\n\nFEATURES\n\n• Kegels & Reverse Kegels. Don’t make the mistake of just training regular kegels… reverse kegels are even more important for male sexual stamina.\n• Detailed Training. Never done a kegel or reverse kegel? Don’t worry, we teach you exactly how to do it.\n• Daily Reminders. If you want to last longer in bed, then you need to practice regularly! We remind you when it’s time for your next exercise. \n• Level Up. As your PC muscles get stronger, you’ll move up in difficulties, giving you greater and greater ejaculatory control.\n• Choose Your Difficulty. Already an experienced kegel practitioner? Skip the easy levels and start where you feel challenged.\n\nBENEFITS OF KEGELS\n\nHere’s everything you get by training your PC muscles guys:\n\n• More intense orgasms \n• Longer orgasms\n• Potential for orgasms without ejaculating, and  multiple orgasms\n• Delayed ejaculation and improved ejaculatory control\n• Boosted libido\n• Stronger, fuller erections\n• Increased ejaculatory power",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "Featured in LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\n\nDa Vinci Eye is the #1 essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

    "description": "Things get messy when you’re stuck running a wildly popular pizza parlor in Papa’s Pizzeria To Go! Top, bake, and serve pizzas in this award-winning game that’s reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch.\n\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the pizzeria, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Topping Station to add a variety of toppings to each pizza.  Move to the Bake Station to cook the pizzas in the oven until they're baked just right.  Jump to the Cutting Station to cut the pizza into perfect slices.  Each station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the pizza-building process.\n\nKeep your customers happy to earn more points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings in the shop, and new customers will start visiting the Pizzeria!  A well-crafted pizza also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\n\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S PIZZERIA TO GO **\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers don't get in the way of the action!\n\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\n\nTOPPING STATION - We've completely redesigned the Topping Station for smaller screens.  Bins of toppings can be scrolled with your thumb, which allows us to have many more toppings than in the original game.  Tap on a bin to select that topping, then tap multiple times on the pizza to add items directly onto the pizza.  You don't need to drag individual toppings onto the pizza, so you can top faster than ever!  A quick swipe on the pizza will send it off the to the Bake Station.\n\nBAKE STATION - Papa Louie's coal-fired oven gets an upgrade!  You can buy new Oven Alarms in the Shop to help you keep track of pizzas in the oven.  Simply drag an alarm onto one of the oven timers, and you'll hear an alert when that pizza is cooked just right.  Buy new Oven Boosters to cook your pizzas even faster than before!\n\nCUTTING STATION - When it's time to cut pizzas, simply touch and drag a line across the pizza to decide where to cut.  If you want even more control to fine-tune your slices, you can also cut using multi-touch!  Use two fingers or thumbs to move each end of the line at the same time, and release to slice your pizza.  If you're having trouble cutting pizzas at the right angle, buy a variety of Cutting Guides in the Shop to cut that perfect slice!\n\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients which can't be found in the original Papa's Pizzeria.  As you play the game, you'll unlock 26 unique ingredients to serve your customers!\n\nCUSTOMIZE YOUR LOBBY - You can spend your hard-earned tips in the Shop, where you can find a variety of posters, furniture, and wallpaper styles for your lobby!  Use the brand-new Lobby tool to add items to your restaurant, and move and arrange them however you like!  Choose from over 140 customization items, and every item you add to the lobby will improve your Waiting Score for your customers!\n\nUPDATED FEATURES - Serve picky closers at the end of the day, earn paychecks as you play, and try to please the finicky Food Critic to earn a Blue Ribbon!\n\n**GAME FEATURES**\n\nHands-on pizza shop in the Papa Louie universe\nAll new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\nMulti-task between topping, baking, and cutting\nShop to buy upgrades, furniture, and posters using your in-game tips\nNew Lobby Editor to customize and decorate your shop\n90 customers to unlock with unique orders\nChallenging Closers and Food Critic\n75 in-game achievements to earn\n\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\n\nPapa's Pizzeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.",

Any or all may be utilized simply by assigning a wager greater than zero to the bet.\n\n•\tNassau\n•\tNassau Automatic Press\n•\tSkins\n•\tDots (Junk- Birdies, greenies, etc))\n•\tSnakes (3 putts)\n•\tVegas (aka Cart-to-Cart or 6-6-6)\n•\tBingo Bango Bongo\n\nTo use the app, you simply select the number of players (2-4), enter their names, and assign a bet value for each of the desired bets. You can choose to use any or all of the bets, and the Golf Accountant will automatically calculate the results as quickly as you enter the scores.\n\nAfter each hole, enter each players score, along with any dots, snakes or Bingo Bingo Bongo for the hole and the app will automatically calculate the win/loss statement for each player on the results tab. You can access the results tab at anytime should a player want to know their current status.\n\nThe results tab produces individual win/loss statements for each player, as well as a breakdown within individual bets. The app lets you easily switch between pages, and you can always return to the bet page to change, add or delete specific bets.\n\nI was always the designated accountant in our group. When the match was over, I would spend considerable time tallying up the different bets\n\nI figured there had to be a better way, and began building a spreadsheet that would quickly and accurately calculate each individual player’s Win/Loss amount. Over the past few years, the spreadsheet grew as bets and complexity were added. The goal was to get a spreadsheet that calculated every bet automatically, as quickly as you enter the scores.\n\nOnce the spreadsheet was finished, I decided to put it in app format to make life easier for the other golf accountants.\n\nThe result is a great calculator, without advertising, and full functionality at a great price. This app allows other golf accountants to be done as they walk off the 18th green. The Golf Accountant app has an option to email the scores and win/loss results to each player for record keeping.\n\nIf you are not the accountant in the group, now you can be. Or at a minimum, you can check the accountant’s work!\n\nHope you download and enjoy the App. \n\nGolf Accountant",
