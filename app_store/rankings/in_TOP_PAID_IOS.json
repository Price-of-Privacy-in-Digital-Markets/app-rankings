    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.\n\n\n\n\n\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money.

It uses advanced image recognition and step tracking technologies to check whether you’re far away from your bed. \n\nAfter ringing, the app asks you to capture another photo of a specified place, it should be where you usually be every time you wake up, such as the bathroom, the kitchen, ... So you just take a photo and do your routine work like washing your face or preparing breakfast. \n\nAnother alternative is using the step counter, which simplifies this process into just nothing. You wake up and go to wherever you want with the device. After reaching enough number of steps, the alarm will automatically turn off. It’s simply a smarter alarm with no additional action., You’ll love using it from the very first time. \n\nFEATURES IN DETAIL\n\n- MUSIC ALARM \no Wake up with your favorite songs\no Listen to them when moving\n\n- FULLY FUNCTIONAL ALARM \no Easy setup with hand-drawn mini-game\no Repeating rule for daily, weekly alarms \no Built-in alarm sounds \no Snooze, Vibrate, Fade-in & Volume for the perfect experience \n\n- MOTION TRACKING \no Innovative motion tracking system to sense your steps\no Smart anti-cheat system to make sure that you are stepping\n\n**IMPORTANT: We do not encourage our users to step so fast when you are not totally awake, this app will just recognize the steps when you aren’t walking too fast.\n\n- IMAGE RECOGNITION\no State-of-the-art image recognizing engine\no Can match both horizontal and vertical pictures\no Strict image comparison to assure you’re leaving your bed and your eyes opened wide enough to take the right picture.\n\n**HINT: Choose a scene that has a stable light condition for better matching results.\n\n- SLEEP TIMER \no Fall asleep with music \no Auto-lock and ready for next alarm \n\n- FLASHLIGHT \no Easy to find way through the dark when you are stepping\n\n- CLOCK \no Full feature clock \no Show/hide seconds, 24 hour format, …",

One click and the tasks appear again as unfinished items on the list.\n\nTo keep an overview, you simply show or hide all completed tasks in the respective list. You can also search within lists, just swipe down.\n\nCreate, edit, delete or move your lists as you like. With this intuitive to-do app, there are no limits to your creativity.\n\nList King supports iCloud sharing.\n\nOf course, this app is completely ad-free and there are no in-app purchases and subscriptions.

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

It is done at the exact transition from day to night or night to day, astronomically this is when the midpoint of the sun has reached the horizon. The Rishis or sages of India observed that at this exact time an immense amount of natural energy is present in the atmosphere and hence by performing Agnihotra at this time, the effects are immensely healing for those performing and all around.",

    "description": "Can’t remember high-level words when you need to use them in the test? This app will increase your C1-C2 level vocabulary – the high-level words you need to use and understand to score Band 8 and above in IELTS. \n\nThis app will increase your C1-C2 vocabulary and help you score Bands 8+ in IELTS.  You will increase your writing and speaking accuracy and learn useful synonyms so you can answer reading and listening questions more quickly.  This app will also help people preparing for Cambridge Advanced or Proficiency tests. \n\nStart by picking one of 25 topics, all related to the IELTS test. The first time you complete a topic, you must do the exercises in order – you can’t skip ahead! This is because you build your active vocabulary through repetition - it’s like having an IELTS teacher in your pocket.\n\nYou will complete 10 different exercises to improve: speed reading, spelling, listening, and accurate use in a sentence. \n\nOnce you have completed and unlocked all of the exercises in a topic, you can review them in any order, at any time. Repeat the topics to try to improve your accuracy, spelling, and to increase your speed-reading time. If you find the words too difficult, try IELTS Vocab 7+. \n\nThis app was written and designed by Pauline Cullen, the author of \n• The Official Cambridge Guide to IELTS \n• Cambridge Vocabulary for IELTS \n• Cambridge Vocabulary for IELTS Advanced \n• Common Mistakes at IELTS Intermediate\n\nThe app was constructed and produced by the amazing people at PEEK Creative, Cambridge, UK. I brought them the individual parts and a picture in my head and they assembled it, gave it an engine and made it work better than I ever imagined.\n\nReviews for IELTS Band 7+ \n‘’Pauline, I am so impressed with the app, I wish I had known about it earlier as my test is on Saturday, however, it is a fantastic rather creative notion - it's not boring and it’s easy to follow.  Moreover, it is really working for me, I began to remember and use all the academic vocabulary that I am familiar with but usually I do not remember to use them. I would like to thank you and appreciate your great effort, Mitch’’\n\n‘Dear Pauline, I have had this app on my iPhone for less than a day. I immediately recognised your system of teaching, which is in all your books. That is that a word could be learnt in different ways at once.  How it is spelt, how does it sound, its meaning, usage in a sentence and its synonyms. This is very helpful indeed. This is what I like about your teaching method and why I bought your app. With many thanks and best wishes, Zhenia.\n\n\nReviews for The Official Cambridge Guide to IELTS:\n\n‘All books from this author are excellent.’ \n‘Worked like a charm for me. My test was exactly what this book showed it would be.’\n‘Very happy...Best book for preparation to sit IELTS and get a high band’\n‘This book is very helpful for IELTS exam I passed very well after using it, having failed the exam previously.’\n‘This is one of the best IELTS course books I've come across. …Highly recommended.’",

In this sense, it may be one of the rare and interesting additions to the App Store. \n\nIf you enjoy subtle, intense boss fights, this is for you. We don’t smother the screen with numbers or excessive effects — engaging combat is the focus.\n\nNow, let us seek out our monsters, and meet them face to face.\n\nAnimus - Stand Alone (Ire SA Edition) is the companion game supplementing continued work on Ire - Blood Memory.\n\n◆◆◆Background\n\"Countless possibilities had been while hope rose and fell, but all were beaten into the dust, bringing an end to the age of champions. The lands now lay desolate and empty but for the acrimonious shadows, enslaved in the falsehood of their own creation. Yet... there is one left wandering the lands in torturous pilgrimage, to escape this prison... or end it.\"\n\n◆◆◆Game Characteristics*\n. Standalone (offline capable)\n. Tactical Action(RPG)\n. Linear progression\n. Tense combat mechanics and boss fights\n. Button mashing will get you killed\n. New perspective (literal and figurative)\n. New bosses and weapons\n. Cutscenes\n. 4 levels of difficulty: Dawn, Midday, Dusk 1~3 (Day 1 ~ Day 4) . 3 different endings (Dawn, Midday, Dusk)\n. 4 area themes\n. 24 main quests (per difficulty)\n. 13/17 sidequests (Dawn/Midday: 13, Dusk: 17)\n. 11 main boss fights (final boss in Dusk)\n. MFi controller compatible\n\n*Following updates: Weapon type and boss\n\n◆◆◆Device Requirement\n. OS: iOS 10 ≥\n. iPhone*: iPhone 6 ≥\n. iPad: iPad Air 2 ≥\n. iPad Mini: iPad mini 4 ≥\n.

    "description": "* The world's number 1 DAF app is used by thousands of people in over one hundred countries. *\n\nDAF Professional has been created to help people who stammer or have a neurological disease such as Parkinson's Disease. It helps people to slow their rate of speech which makes it clearer to others.\n\nDAF Professional is an easy to use professional speech therapy tool which could make a huge difference to you or someone you know.\n\nDAF Professional has been designed and tested by a certified and practicing Speech and Language Therapist (MSc, PGDip, BAHons, HPC registered and member of RCSLT). DAF Professional delivers incredibly low latency feedback even when running in the background.\n\nDelayed Auditory Feedback (DAF) is a well established speech and language therapy tool which helps people to speak more slowly. However, until recently, devices have been cumbersome to carry around, difficult to adjust, very expensive and therefore not widely used.\n\nDAF was originally developed for people who stammer, but has since been shown to work with people with other speech difficulties, such as those with Parkinson's Disease (Downie et al., 1981; Dagenaise, Outhwood & Lee, 1998; Lowit et al., 2006 and most recentely Lowit et al., 2010).\n\nIt works by enabling someone to hear his or her own speech in an altered manner. This disruption to the normal auditory feedback loop causes the speaker to slow down. Research has shown that DAF will be of benefit to approximately a third of people who have a stammer or Parkinson's. Clinical research has not been carried out as yet on other client groups however DAF may well be of benefit to people with other medical speech conditions.  \n\nWhen using Bluetooth devices there is an additional delay of 60ms added to the feedback system.\n\nIf you do use a Bluetooth headset you may find you need to turn the bluetooth device on after opening the app to enable it.\n\nDAF Professional works when put in the background or the screen is turned off. Like all apps of this type, it can NOT work during phone calls or with other media apps playing at the same time.\n\nIf you wish to provide any feedback we would be delighted to hear from you. Please email us at support@speechtools.co.\n\nOur lead Speech and Language Therapist is Samantha Brady who qualified as a Speech and Language Therapist in 2001 (PGDip, City University) and gained her Masters in Speech and Language Therapy in 2006 (MSc, City University). She has a wealth of experience of working as a Speech and Language Therapist in a variety of settings and her area of clinical expertise is adult neurology and voice. Samantha is a member of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT), HPC Registered (SL10250) and Lee Silverman Voice Treatment Certified (LSVT).\n\nDAF Professional is fully GDPR compliant and will not collect any of your data without first asking for your consent.",

    "description": "DoubleTake by FiLMiC transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 13 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and 2020.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 13, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nDoubleTake gives you an early look at the multi-cam capability that will be coming to our award-winning cinema camera app FiLMiC Pro.  \n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll.",

AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning.\n\nEven if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.\n\nIf you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher.

Each vocab flashcard has a silly cartoon, a clear definition of the word with an example sentence, and a memorable mnemonic to make it easier to remember the word. \n\nHere's a mnemonic example so you know what I'm talking about: \"prodigal\" means \"wasteful\". The prodigal Prada gal spent $1500 on a pair of Prada boots. Get it? :)\n\nThe app's smart spaced repetition system shows you words when you need to review them to make your GRE vocabulary studying more efficient and effective. There's also a streak feature to help keep you motivated to use the app consistently.

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active. Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet. But still we know that things can get even better. Your feedback and priorities will drive our work ahead, and you’ll see new features and more supported websites in our next app updates.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.

Attackers, Defenders, Seekers (hide & seek), Followers, Explorers, and more! They can also traverse the worlds you build autonomously!\n\nITEMS\nEvery item in the game has properties you can adjust! Want to change how powerful the Mines are? Go for it! Want to make your Ragdolls giant!? Do it!
