    "description": "Featured in LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\nDa Vinci Eye is the #1 essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

We've tried all the apps that let you do it over WiFi, but they're not fast enough, so we also allow you to use a wired USB connection.\n\nQUALITY VIDEO\nYour iPhone/iPad camera's are good, really good. In fact, there’s no comparison between the highly recommended streaming webcam, the Logitech C922 HD Pro and the iPhone 6 Camera. Stream Landscape or Portrait video.\n\nAUDIO\nIf you don't have a separate mic for your streaming setup, you can now use the microphone on your iOS device to stream audio & video.\n\nFRONT CAMERA\nStream a selfie with the front camera support. Switch anytime during the stream with the familiar camera switch button.\n\nTAP TO FOCUS, PINCH TO ZOOM\nControls just like you're used to from the Camera app.\n\nMANUAL CONTROLS\nTake control of the focus, exposure, white balance as you would on a manual DSLR camera.\n\nLOW LATENCY\nStream video over a wired USB connection. This avoids the issue of delay over wifi, as many other solutions suffer from. This is just as fast as a USB webcam!\n\nUSB & WIFI\nChoose the connection type. If you want low latency, use USB, if you'd like portability then use WiFi. WiFi is done using the NewTek™ NDI® protocol, so you can use Camera for OBS Studio with any NewTek™ NDI® compatible receiver.\n\nMULTIPLE DEVICES\nIf you're lucky enough to own multiple iOS devices, use them together and produce a multi-camera stream.\n\nMAC AND PC\nSupports OBS Studio running on macOS and Windows.\n\nYou will need to install the OBS Studio iOS Camera Plugin from our website, or use an NDI compatible receiver to use this app.\n\nFor the best possible experience make sure you device is listed on our website https://obs.camera/docs/faqs/#what-ios-hardware-do-i-need",

    "description": "SPL Meter is a professional-grade sound level meter, also known as a decibel or dB meter, for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch.\n\nModeled after a traditional analog SPL meter, we have faithfully reproduced all the characteristics and qualities found in those meters, including the ballistics, ranges, filters, and decay rates.\n\nUnder the hood we have advanced DSP-based algorithms that meet or exceed ANSI / IEC Type 1 standards. And starting with iOS 6, we can disable the mic filters and limiters, to get the real world performance of a hand-held SPL meter.\n\nAnd now, upgrade SPL Meter with iTestMic, our pro-grade test & measurement mic, made specifically for iOS devices. Using iTestMic with SPL Meter, you get a calibrated, accurate SPL Meter, that meets industry standards for Type 2 performance. See our website for more information.\n\nBut don't compare us to a Radio Shack meter, ours is much more accurate! \n\nWe have also included a digital LCD display, as shown in the image, to make this the best SPL meter available for iPhone or iPad. And this is something that the old analog meters never had! \n\nThe screen will flip when you flip the phone over, so that you can point the iPhone mic directly at the sound source. (iPhone X does not support upside down mode)\n\nSPL Meter is a universal app -- buy once, and use on all of your iOS devices.\n\nSPL Meter is built by the same team that created the other great professional audio and acoustics apps on the store, Studio Six Digital.  Built on the engine of our more expensive \"SPL\" app, SPL Meter's filters and decay rates meet or exceed ANSI type 1. This app is not a toy or a game.\n\nSPL Meter is the one audio app that everyone who works in audio must have on their phone! Not only have we made the best one, but we've priced it so you can't afford not to get it.\n\n*** FEATURES:\n\nFILTERS -- A and C weighting filters are provided.\n\nDECAY -- Choose ANSI Fast or Slow.\n\nRANGES -- 40dB to 120dB in 9 ranges.\n\nCALIBRATION -- Comes pre-calibrated for the typical iPhone or iPad built-in and headset mic, but you can adjust the calibration if you have a professional, calibrated meter to compare it to. Accesses our cloud-based iOS device calibration database, which we updates as new devices are released.\n\nINTERNAL / EXTERNAL MIC -- Select Internal to activate the included compensation filter, which is designed to flatten the frequency response of the built-in or headset mic. External will work with our iPhone Measurement Mic, to be released later this summer. See our website for more details.\n\nSPL Meter is bargain-priced to make it easy for anyone to check out one of our professional, accurate apps. Studio Six Digital is dedicated to making the iPhone and Touch a professional audio and acoustics test device.\n\nCheck out our full line of professional-grade audio and acoustics apps: SPL, the professional digital iPhone sound level meter, SPL Graph, for recording SPL over time, RTA, a 1/3 octave real-time analyzer,  FFT, for detailed acoustic analysis, ETC, the energy-time curve function, RT60, for automated octave-band decay time measurement, Speaker Pop, to test speaker polarity, and Generator, the iPhone signal generator.\n\nAlso, if you are looking for more great acoustical and audio test apps, have a look at AudioTools, our premier app for audio professionals.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Sony Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Sony TV.\n\nThis works on any Sony Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. \n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Sony TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Sony TV app. It will start looking for your Sony TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Sony TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Sony TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

You can choose to use any or all of the bets, and the Golf Accountant will automatically calculate the results as quickly as you enter the scores.\n\nAfter each hole, enter each players score, along with any dots, snakes or Bingo Bingo Bongo for the hole and the app will automatically calculate the win/loss statement for each player on the results tab. You can access the results tab at anytime should a player want to know their current status.\n\nThe results tab produces individual win/loss statements for each player, as well as a breakdown within individual bets. The app lets you easily switch between pages, and you can always return to the bet page to change, add or delete specific bets.\n\nI was always the designated accountant in our group. When the match was over, I would spend considerable time tallying up the different bets\n\nI figured there had to be a better way, and began building a spreadsheet that would quickly and accurately calculate each individual player’s Win/Loss amount. Over the past few years, the spreadsheet grew as bets and complexity were added. The goal was to get a spreadsheet that calculated every bet automatically, as quickly as you enter the scores.\n\nOnce the spreadsheet was finished, I decided to put it in app format to make life easier for the other golf accountants.\n\nThe result is a great calculator, without advertising, and full functionality at a great price. This app allows other golf accountants to be done as they walk off the 18th green. The Golf Accountant app has an option to email the scores and win/loss results to each player for record keeping.\n\nIf you are not the accountant in the group, now you can be. Or at a minimum, you can check the accountant’s work!\n\nHope you download and enjoy the App. \n\nGolf Accountant",

    "description": "This tool allows to examine fundamental characteristics, performing analysis both in steady-state and in transient state conditions, of a three phase induction motor. \nIn this version has added the capability to examine the behaviour of an induction motor in an open loop control.\nIn particular to perform the transient analysis, a complex Runge Kutta solver has been implemented. The implemented mathematical solver is suitable for solving the mathematical model [5th order differential equation system] of a 3 phase asynchronous motor. In order to optimize a mobile device resources some simplifying assumptions have been made on the electrical machine mathematical model.",

    "description": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nShould you choose not to subscribe, after one year, you will continue to receive updates in the form of bug fixes and compatibility updates with the latest devices, iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4 then, that very same app in 2020 is now optimized for iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad Pro running iOS 13, as well as on Apple Watch—and you don’t have to pay a single cent more to use the app on these devices, on the new iOS.\n\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later.",

Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength. All this data appears on the dash and can be managed with the mode switch, keeping your hands where they belong: on the handlebar.",

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",

This was inspired by TrueCrypt and makes brute force attacks longer. The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher, key size or cipher mode of operation.\n• Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\n• The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'.

    "description": "Flyskyhy forms your flight instrument during flight and shows all information you need for that. You get the normal data like altitude, climb rate, ground speed, and glide angle. But it also calculates and shows the current wind direction and strength, very important for your safety.\n\nA moving and rotating map shows your current flying position and flight trail. It indicates where you have gone up (in a thermal), and where you have had faster than normal decline. With that, you can easily find back that thermal that you lost. The map also shows the nearest known landing spots, and whether they are reachable by normal glide, given your current altitude and wind direction.\n\nIntegration with Bluetooth varios SensBox, FlyNet, GoFly iPico, XC-Tracer, BlueFlyVario, or SkyDrop gives accurate altitude and lift information. That turns your iPhone into an full-fletched GPS-vario, including vario tones.\n\nThe app makes a full log of your flight, that can be analyzed afterwards. Besides normal data like start and landing positions, duration of flight, and an altitude graph of the flight, Flyskyhy also calculates the scoring distances for you. So you can immediately see whether you have broken that FAI triangle record.\n\nYour live location is reported on livetrack24.com or loctome.com if you desire, so anybody can follow your flight while it is happening. If you are flying together with friends, then their location is shown on your map during your flight. So you never have to wonder anymore whether they are in front of or behind you.\n\nThe flight display has multiple screens which are all fully configurable. You can move all elements to other spots, delete and add elements, and resize them.\n\nThrough in-app purchases, the app also supports airspaces and waypoints.\n\nThe app is optimised for paragliding and hang gliders, but can be used with all  kinds of airsports.\n\nMain features during the flight;\n• Altitude, climb rate, ground speed, air speed, direction, glide angle and many more\n• Wind strength and direction\n• Moving map of the flying area\n• Spots where you have had lift, great for thermal coring\n• Shows whether you can still reach a landing spot with the current altitude and wind\n• Live tracking of your flight on livetrack24.com or loctome.com\n• Shows live location of your friends during flight\n\nAfter the flight:\n• Full logbook of all your flights\n• Basic flight data like start/landing, duration, height difference, distance flown, and many more\n• Calculation of 5-points, open triangle, and FAI triangle distances\n• Graph of altitude and climb rate\n• Signed IGC and KML log files of flights\n• Transfer the log to iTunes or send by email\n• Upload the flight directly to XContest, ParaglidingForum, DHV-XC, and other Leonardo servers\n• Open flight in Google Earth on the iPhone\n• Replay the flight and relive it!\n\nBy purchasing the Waypoints Extension you get access to:\n• A fully zoomable and scrollable map with the waypoints and optimised route. The map also shows start and landing spots, as well as restricted airspaces (with the Airspace Extension)\n• Enter new waypoints, either on the map or by specifying the parameters\n• Full route support with start time, goal, entry/exit points, etc. \n• Many instruments to guide you along the route\n• Visible and audible indication when a waypoint has been reached\n• Complete waypoints organiser\n• Import and export of various waypoint file formats\n\nBy purchasing the Airspace Extension you get access to:\n• Airspaces of 30 countries\n• Display of airspaces on the map with configurable colors and formats\n• Display of your vertical position w.r.t. airspaces\n• Visible and audible warnings when approaching and entering an airspace\n• Shows local airspaces by touching a spot on the map\n\nNote: a live internet connection is required for live tracking of your and your friends locations\nNote: continuous GPS and screen usage makes the battery drain faster than normal",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any LG Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your LG TV.\n\nThis works on any LG Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. \n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your LG TV. Don't use multiple VLANs, a VPN or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for LG TV app. It will start looking for your LG TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model LG TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for LG TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Mirroring made Easy\" - 5 STARS - by JBGuam\nAbsolutely great app, worked seamlessly with my tv, lag was minimal, but to be fair only receiving 40-45 mbs instead of 100+ mbs in the particular room I tried this. Should be even better with faster internet speeds.\n\n\"Works Great!!\" - 5 STARS - by czerkman\nNot sure why others had problems, I followed the directions and it worked perfectly. Ingenious idea from a developers standpoint.\n\n\"The app works great\" - 5 STARS - by Alivesbg\nNo problems... Good set by step set-up.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n\nAudio & Sound\n\n* The Safari Browser cannot mirror audio from websites. To mirror sound on websites, please download our additional app VIDEO & TV CAST and open the website inside VIDEO & TV CAST instead of Safari\n\n* If a third party app, for example Spotify, does not mirror sound correctly, please FORCE CLOSE and restart Spotify while the mirroring session is active.

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

Using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, you will help Taylor make life or death decisions, and face the consequences together.\n\nAcclaimed writer Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) weaves a gripping interactive story through the aftermath of a crash landing on an alien moon. Taylor is stranded, the rest of the crew are dead or missing, and Taylor’s communicator can only reach you. \n\nA totally unique experience enabled by modern devices, this story plays out in real time. As Taylor works to stay alive, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Taylor directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.\n\nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and see what happens when you make a different choice. Simple actions can have a profound effect. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n\nLifeline is a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes. Taylor is relying on YOU.\n\nNEW in version 1.8: Stick around after the game for a special story epilogue from Dave Justus. For players who have already finished the game, the Sneak Peek becomes available under the game options. Enjoy!\n\nInternet connection not required. No in-app purchases and no ads.\n\nWATCH US: http://www.youtube.com/c/LifelineGame\n\nPraise for Lifeline:\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“I felt an immediate attachment to a fictional character pinging me from a strange galaxy to my wearable.” - Luke Hopewell, Gizmodo Australia\n\n“[P]laying it on the Apple Watch makes you truly feel like you’re exchanging messages with an astronaut via a futuristic transmitter.” - Michael Andronico, Tom’s Guide\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\n\nLifeline was created by:\nDave Justus\nMars Jokela\nDan Selleck\nColin Liotta\nJason Nowak\nBen “Books” Schwartz",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat. Also their support is brilliant, they responded in less than an hour of the query I emailed to them.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

    "description": "Have you ever wondered what it’s like to land the Space Shuttle? Now you can find out. F-Sim Space Shuttle is a critically acclaimed flight simulator for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It simulates the Space Shuttle approach and landing in incredible detail and accuracy. We’ve tried to combine realistic flight dynamics with stunning graphics and fun game play: Each landing attempt takes just a few minutes. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again.\n\nNo ads, no in-app-purchases.\n\nEach flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. Landing the Orbiter takes practice, but the built-in autopilot demo and tutorials will get you started. After your first safe touchdown,  chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different weather conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles. \n\nYou control the Orbiter’s pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we’ve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they’ll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it’s your turn to give it a try.\n\nHere’s what others have said about it:\n\n“Because this app is so visually exciting, so technically deep, so sophisticated, so beautifully done in its realism, effects, and documentation, it earned a perfect 5/5 rating, Outstanding.”\nJohn Martellaro, Senior Editor for Reviews, The Mac Observer\n\n“I was excited to see that I can enjoy flying the space shuttle realistically also on my iPhone and complement my addiction to our Space Shuttle Mission Simulator on PC when I am on the road.”\nAlex L., www.space-shuttle-mission.com\n\n“Absolutely awesome app that is a must for shuttle huggers and aspiring astronauts.”\nChris Bergin, Managing Editor, NASASpaceflight.com\n\nF-Sim Space Shuttle takes full advantage of modern iOS devices, but also runs smoothly on older hardware. We’ve tested it on all iOS devices, and iOS versions 3 to 7.",

Load a background image.\n2. Load a foreground image.\n3. Mask out unwanted portion of the foreground image using wide range of masking tools.\n4. Smoothen the edges with smoothen tool inside the app, if required.\n5. Move, Scale, Resize, Rotate, Flip the foreground to place it on the right location on the background image.\n6. Adjust the colors/exposure/contrast/hue/saturation etc. of the foreground and the background images if required to match both the images in terms of colors.\n7. You are done! Save the blended image to the photo library at full resolution or share it on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nYou can also use this tool to do serious photo editing tasks like blending textures or overlaying borders or to do double exposure with adjustable transparency and 18 blending modes.\n\nMasking in the app is the most powerful one available on the app store, just tap on an area of the photo, and the app will mask out all the connected area with similar colors. Or you can use brush, lasso, polygon, global color similarity, rectangle, ellipse, linear, bi-linear, radial gradient, mask from image, mask from text, magic mask and hair refine masking tools. Mask an area with this tool and that area of the foreground image will become transparent and reveal the background.\n\nYou can even drop a shadow of the foreground onto the background.",

    "description": "This guided meditation digital recording and book from New York Times best-selling authors Esther and Jerry Hicks explains  how \"getting into the vortex\" is essential for manifestation using the Law of Attraction. Gain an understanding of what the \"vortex of creation\" means and how you can use meditation to enter the vortex in order to allow the Law of Attraction to work for you. Also gain valuable insights about what happens to your affirmations and manifestation efforts when you are out of the vortex.  Five guided meditation audio sessions with music are included in this app.  \n\nListeners will be led by Abraham through four guided meditation sessions on these topics: General Well-Being, Financial Abundance, Physical Well-Being and Relationships.   Each guided meditation experience is 15 minutes long.   \n\nThis Vortex of Attraction Guided Meditation iPhone App is an exact duplicate of the physical product and includes the complete written text, and the complete audio recording along with an extra bonus track of guided meditation music which was not included with the original product.\n\nMany people exert manifestation and Law of Attraction efforts outside of the Vortex, and then conclude that the Law of Attraction \"doesn't work.\" Find out how to stop efforting and start allowing the Vortex of Creation to align you with the life you desire.  These are the first guided meditation recordings ever produced containing the Teachings of Abraham.",

Ideal for almost anything that requires measuring outdoor distance traveled such as walking, running, driving, boating, or hiking.  Note that GPS does not work well under a roof.  For best results, use outdoors.\n\nBenefits of the paid version:\n- Landscape and splitscreen support.\n- Ability to have multiple trips.  Each trip can be stopped and started independently.\n- Receive notifications while the application is closed at distance intervals of your choosing.\n- Custom units readout.  For example, you want to know how many calories you have burned.  You can customize this to include anything that has a linear relationship with distance traveled.  This can be different for each trip.\n- No advertisements.\n- Export trips via email and optionally restore later.\n\nDisplays:\n- Distance\n- Time elapsed\n- Speed (average or current)\n- Displacement (straight line distance from your starting point) This can be hidden.\n\nDistance units include:\n- Kilometers\n- Miles\n- Nautical miles\n- Meters\n- Feet\n\nSpeed units include:\n- Kilometers per hour\n- Miles per hour\n- Nautical miles per hour\n- Meters per second\n- Feet per second\n\nOther features:\n- Large font adjustable display.\n- Accurate to within 1 percent when compared to most car odometers under normal driving conditions.\n- Includes a lock to help prevent accidental reset of your trip. After unlocked, it locks back in a few seconds, or you can lock it yourself.\n- Approximates distance traveled in some GPS dead spots such as driving through a tunnel by adding the as-a-bird flies distance to your trip.\n\nPlease also note:\n- GPS Odometer does run in the background if you leave it running.  Be sure to pause the trip when you are finished or battery life will be negatively affected.  The timer stops when the trip is paused.\n- To change the display, tap the unlock button and notice the three green boxes that temporarily appear. Each button adjusts a different part of the display.\n- You can change the language to English in the application settings.\n\nPlease visit the web page for more details.",

Knowing the capacity of your tank is also very important when you need to figure the dosage of a supplement or medication.\n\n• See just how much the water in your aquarium weighs to insure you have a stand that is strong enough to support it.\n\n• Determine how much substrate you need.\n\n• This app is also very helpful if you acquire a second hand aquarium not knowing how much water it holds.\n\nSupported configurations:\n\n1.\tBow - Front\n2.\tBullnose\n3. \tCorner\n4.\tCorner Pentagon\n5.\tCylinder\n6.\tDouble - Bullnose\n7.\tElliptical\n8.\tHalf - Cylinder\n9.\tL - Shape\n10.\tMulti - Sided\n11.\tQuarter Circle\n12.\tRectangular / Square\n13.\tSpherical\n14.\tTrapezoid\n15.\tTriangular\n\n• Find the dimensions and weight of some of the most popular tank sizes.\n\n• All volume and weight calculations are based on the amount of water a tank can hold and does not include the tank itself. Since there are many tank manufacturers and variations in materials, such as glass thickness, I cannot possibly know the weight of your tank. It is up to you to know that. Rocks, plants, sand, decorations, and other accessories in your tank will cause a discrepancy between actual and calculated volumes and capacities. Since I cannot possibly know what you have in your tank besides water it is up to you to figure out the weight of the contents.\n\n• Measurements listed under common tank sizes are close approximations due to slight, but almost insignificant variations among manufacturers.\n\n• I have chosen not to include any information on fish since I would have to rely on someone else's research.",

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. For this reason, please familiarize yourself with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nAside from the cloud synchronization service, AnkiMobile also supports copying decks to and from your device via the USB cable and iTunes.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: http://ankisrs.net/docs/AnkiMobile.html\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

Her Story points to the future\" 5/5, The Guardian\n\nHer Story is the critically acclaimed mystery game from Sam Barlow. Playing like an interactive true crime documentary, the game lets you go hands on with a police database full of live action video footage. It stars Viva Seifert, actress and one half of the band Joe Gideon and the Shark.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nHer Story sits you in front of a mothballed desktop computer and logs you into a police database. Search through hundreds of video clips that cover seven interviews from 1994 in which a British woman is interviewed about her missing husband. Explore the database by typing search terms, watch the clips where she speaks those words and piece together her story.\n\n\"Her Story is a beautiful amalgam of the cinema and video game formats... a remarkable achievement...\" 90, The Washington Post\n\n\"Profound, gripping live-action drama… sure to be discussed for years to come\" 5/5, Digital Spy\n\nUnlike anything you've played before, Her Story is an involving and moving experience.

    "description": "Drive your car through a zombie apocalypse in this massive follow-up to the chart-topping hit Earn to Die!\n\nAn evacuation ship is waiting on the other side of the country. The only thing that stands in your way: city after city overrun by zombies . With only a run-down car and a small amount of cash you face a familiar situation... to drive through hordes of zombies in order to survive!\n\nBRAND NEW STORY MODE\nEarn to Die 2 introduces a massive new Story Mode, five times longer than its predecessor. The game departs its familiar desert setting and delves into the depths of cities infested by zombies. \n\nMULTI-TIERED LEVELS:\nLevels are now multi-tiered! Drive across decayed highway overpasses, via underground tunnels, or smash through epic zombie filled factories. Whichever path you choose to take, you won't be able to escape the zombie hordes - your only choice is to smash through them!\n\nBUILD A ZOMBIE-SLAUGHTERING MACHINE\nUnlock and upgrade 10 different vehicles, including a sports car, a fire truck, and even an ice-cream van. Each vehicle can be equipped with a range of upgrades, such as armored frames, roof-mounted guns, boosters and more. Those zombies will stand no chance.\n\nDESTRUCTIBLE VEHICLES\nVehicles are now fully destructible. Hang on for your life as your vehicle gets smashed to smithereens if you aren't too careful.\n\nMORE ZOMBIES. MORE DESTRUCTION. MORE MAYHEM.\nWhat are you waiting for?

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year. \n  \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves or a White Balance picker. The Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows or sharpen your photo, among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. Use our built-in RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and keep using the tools you are already familiar with.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nEVERYTHING INCLUDED - no IAPs\nCamera+ 2 works great on iPhone and iPad. Use the same tools consistently across all your devices, and take advantage of multitasking in iPad. All features are included in your purchase for all platforms - no in-app purchases required.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.\n\nLIGHTBOX\nPhotos taken with Camera+ 2 go to the Lightbox by default. Filter them easily to focus on the ones you want to work on, and use the built-in editors to create the exact look you are aiming for. Save or share the final versions when you are done.",

    "description": "Thank you for all the feedback we've received. It's great to hear that the app is helping children learn to read and write all over the world. If you have any problems with our app, then we are happy to help you! Simply send us an email to support@jollylearning.co.uk.\n\nWe're very pleased to announce that 'Jolly Phonics Letter Sounds' has been reviewed by the Educational App Store website and has been awarded their highest certification level of 5 stars!\n\nYou can read the full review here:\nhttp://www.educationalappstore.com/app/jolly-phonics-letter-sounds\n\nApp Overview:\nStart your child’s journey in reading and writing. Join Bee and her friends as they explore the enchanting letter-sounds garden and discover the main 42 letter sounds of English through a series of captivating games. This beautifully animated app enables your child to learn the letter sounds (including digraphs), letter formation, blending the sounds for reading and identifying letter sounds in words for spelling and writing. Together these skills give your child the best possible start as they learn to read and write.\n\nIdeal for children aged 3+, the Jolly Phonics Letter Sounds app provides hours of educational enjoyment.\n\nJolly Phonics leads the teaching of phonics around the world. It is the most effective way to teach reading and writing, enabling children to achieve outstanding results at school and at home. \n\nKey Features:\n◆ Suitable for children aged 3+\n◆ Choice of American or British English audio and spelling (this can be toggled within the information page)\n◆ Choice of print or precursive letters* (this can be toggled within the information page)\n◆ Allows multiple and personalized profiles \n◆ Activities for learning the main sounds in English. The children learn to:\n   ▸ hear the letter sounds\n   ▸ recognize the letter sounds\n   ▸ see letter formation\n   ▸ write the letters themselves \n   ▸ blend sounds in words for reading\n   ▸ identify sounds in words for spelling\n◆ 7 bonus games to unlock\n◆ Tested and loved by children\n◆ Guidance for adults provided\n\nFrequently asked questions\n◆ Why is there no option to take a picture when creating a new plant pot?\nYou need to allow the app to use your device's camera. To do this first close the app, then access the Settings app and scroll down on the left-hand side and touch 'Jolly Phonics Letter Sounds'. You should see a switch to allow the app to access your device's camera. Switch this on, then open the Jolly Phonics Letter Sounds App again.\n\n◆ I can't hear any sound. What can I do?\nThe app now detects if your device sound setting is on mute and displays a speaker button giving an option to override this. Volume controls on the device can then be adjusted as necessary. Headphones can be used at any time to hear sound in the app regardless of whether the device is muted or not.\n\n◆ How do I unlock letter sound groups?\nThe app takes you through each letter sound one at a time. If you wish to unlock subsequent or all letter sound groups (e.g. for teaching purposes), then please read the information page in the app for details of the 'edit mode', accessible via an invisible button.\n\nWhile this App works on iPhones and iPod Touches that meet the minimum requirements, it is best viewed on iPad devices due to the bigger screen size.\n\nPlease note that this app is only available in English but can be set to either American or British English. The app does not contain the Jolly Phonics Actions.\n\n*Precursive letters have joining tails to assist with learning joined-up writing; print letters have no joining tails.",

    "description": "Necrophonic is an ITC app used for spirit communication and EVP research.\n\n8 Sounds Banks:\n\nThe audio has been mastered in a way to bring out various sound properties . \nUsing Pro Tools I was able to enhance high, mid, and low range frequencies. I also applied \nother filters to create unique sound characteristics to help layer the audio and create an \nenvironment suitable for spirit communication.\n\nThe audio itself is made up of phonemes, \npartial words, reverse audio, foreign languages, and other parts of speech that can help \nspirits communicate. Besides some basic phonetic sounds such as na, no, da, do, di, ma, may, etc.\nthere are no real words of phrases contained in the banks.\n\nThese sounds banks play in a similar\nway to that of my other app \"Spiritus Ghost Box\" but instead of 4 sound banks Necrophonic has\n8 active sound banks.\n\nWhite Noise Sound Bank:\n\nThis app also has an optional 9th sound bank called \"White noise\". \nThis bank can be used alone or with the other 8 giving you a total of 9 sound banks. This \naudio is taken for the internal sounds of the famous DR60 recorder that is known as the \n\"Holy Grail\" of EVP recorders. This is not a White Noise Generator, this is a normal sound bank like the others but this one contains white noise from the DR60.\n\nAudio Effects:\n\nThis app does contain Echo and Reverb audio effects. These have been proven \nto be the best effects to apply to ITC sessions. The echo can create audio that can be \nmanipulated within the echo itself. Echo can also help in live, real time communication by \nrepeating the audio and allowing you to better hear whats coming through. Reverb can be \napplied to the audio to create a spacious sound environment that will enhance audio manipulation.",
