Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

Play with friends or strangers in online play, or play offline with friends face-to-face!\n\nExploding Kittens, the most-funded game in Kickstarter history, is now available for iOS.\n\nCreat​ed by Elan Lee (Xbox, ARGs), Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal), and Shane Small (Xbox, Marvel).\n\nKEY FEATURES:\n\n- Exploding Kittens is a multiplayer card game for people who are into kittens and explosions and laser beams and sometimes goats.\n\n- Play with 2 to 5 players across multiple phones in the same room, or online with friends or strangers\n\n- All art illustrated by The Oatmeal\n\n- New cards exclusive to the digital version of Exploding Kittens\n\n- The digital version of the most backed game in Kickstarter history\n\nIn this highly-strategic, kitty-powered version of Russian Roulette, players draw cards until someone draws an Exploding Kitten, at which point they explode, they are dead, and they are out of t​he game -- unless that player has a Defuse card, which can defuse the Kitten using things like laser pointers, belly rubs, and catnip sandwiches. All of the other cards in the deck are used to move, mitigate, or avoid the Exploding Kittens.\n\n\n\n\n\nExploding Kittens is a paid app in which optional game features may be purchased with real money. You must be at least 13 years old to download and play. There is also an option to compete online against strangers and resulting data transfer charges may apply.

    "description": "Hydra offers innovative photo capture technology, and lets you take beautiful pictures even in the most difficult lighting conditions, which makes it a great companion to iOS Camera app.\n\n“The Hydra app from Belgian company Creaceed is one of the more interesting iOS camera apps we have seen in the recent past.”\n— DPReview\n\n“Hydra is for people who enjoy iPhone photography at a higher and more rewarding level.”\n— David Robinson (iPhonographer)\n\n\"Hydra has the particularity of offering original features, which are missing from many competing apps.\"\n— iPhon.fr\n\nHydra captures more light by merging up to 60 frames to make a single high-quality picture (less noise, more highlights/shadows) on iPhone and iPad. Hydra also goes beyond the 8- or 12-megapixel sensor limit, with up to 32-megapixel high-resolution images. It uses the latest evolutions of iPhone and iPad camera hardware, as well as the latest camera APIs and GPU rendering technologies.\n\nHydra provides 5 specific capture modes: HDR, Video-HDR, Lo-Light, Zoom, and Hi-res modes. \n\n• Hydra's High Dynamic Range (HDR) mode is based on an alternate method that captures up to 20 images and that is made to handle even the most difficult lighting conditions. \n• Video-HDR uses single-image tone mapping and device-specific sensor mode to create stunning videos. \n• Lo-Light mode removes sensor noise by merging together multiple images and amplifying light by a factor of 10 to provide a better image quality.\n• Zoom mode uses real-time, super-resolution technique to recreate missing pixels from hand motion, producing 2x, 4x and 8x (telephoto lens) scale factors with more details than the standard digital zooming technique(*).\n• Hi-res mode produces up to 32MP images from the regular 8 or 12MP camera sensor, providing finer details in captured image(*).\n• Hydra supports the telephoto & front cameras respectively in Zoom and Lo-Light/HDR modes to shoot portraits & selfies.\n• Camera support: ultra wide, wide, telephoto, and front facing.\n\nHydra also features a photo gallery for reviewing images and their metadata, directly linked with built-in iOS photo album, thus avoiding duplicates and allowing to flag as favorites.\n\n(*) recommended for static scenes or distant scenery. Rendering artifacts can occur for scenes with parallax and for moving subjects.",

    "description": "Featured in LifeHacker, Apple News, The Guardian, AR / VR journey, and more!\nDa Vinci Eye is the #1 essential digital tool for non-digital artists. Don’t just take our word for it - we’re one of the top five Graphics & Design apps in over 100 countries.\n\nDa Vinci Eye is used by thousands of creatives from painters to bakers to make incredible artwork. The app is not just for tracing, it offers a wide range of drawing tools, lessons, daily drawing prompts, and a supportive community to share your artwork!\n\nIMPORTANT!: Please read how this app works below and the device requirements for AR Mode BEFORE purchasing.\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\n• Create incredible artwork from your own photos\n• Make hyper-realistic drawings with our strobe feature\n• Record time-lapse videos of your drawings\n• Separate images into layers by color value, then view those areas on your canvas\n• Easily learn the fundamentals of drawing\n• Breakdown any image into step-by-step instructions\n• Video tutorials\n• Use filters to make drawing even easier\n• Zoom in to capture micro details in your drawings\n• Connect with our community to share your artwork\n• Insanely fast customer support!\n\nPERFECT FOR ANY ARTIST\n\n• Bakers\n• Cartoonists\n• Tattoo Artists\n• Illustrators\n• Fiverr Designers\n• Hobbyists\n• Makeup artists\n• Nail Technicians\n• Animators\n\nNo matter what skill level you’re at — Da Vinci Eye is here for you!\n\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow many times have you been drawing a portrait for hours only to realize that the nose or the eye is in the wrong place? You can use Da Vinci Eye to layout artwork before you begin or even check your work as you progress.\n\nHaving a hard time seeing where lights or darks go? Breakdown images into layers by color value. Then virtually project those layers on top of your image. You can see exactly where to place the darkest darks, mid-tones, and highlights.\n\nCAN'T THINK OF WHAT TO DRAW?\n\nCheck out our inspiration section for user uploaded reference photos. If you have a great pic, you can even upload your own content for other artists to draw.\n\nLEARNING HOW TO DRAW?\n\nWe have lessons using our unique patent-pending learning method. You can also turn ANY photo into a step by step shading drawing lesson.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nBased on a tool that has been used by artists for centuries, this app is a digital version of a Camera Lucida.\n\nYou suspend your iPhone or iPad above or in front of your canvas with a stand, tall glass, or other objects easily found around your house. \n\nWhen you look through your phone, you will see both the image and the canvas simultaneously. It's similar in functionality to an art projector or light box, but with the ability to do so much more.\n\nYou can draw on any surface, zoom in to draw micro details in your drawing, and you don't have to draw in the dark.\n\nWILL THIS HELP ME LEARN HOW TO DRAW?\n\nUsing Da Vinci Eye, you will be training your eye to recognize proportions and draw with shading while training your hand to translate precise lines and strokes on paper. You’ll learn faster and more efficiently using our proven techniques compared to any other app.\n\nAR MODE REQUIREMENTS\n\nTo use AR mode, you must have an A10x or A11 processor and above. We recommend using:\n\n– iPhone 8 and newer (iPhone 7 and below will not work)\n– iPad Mini 5th Generation and newer\n– iPad Air 2019 and newer\n– iPad Pro 3rd Gen (Any pro made after 2018) and newer\n\nAR & CLASSIC MODE\n\nAR mode anchors your image to an object in the real world. This lets you move your canvas or phone, and the drawing and projected image will stay aligned.\n\nClassic mode is like a normal art projector, where if you move your phone or canvas, the drawing will no longer be aligned.\n\nAR mode is especially useful for drawing or painting on an easel. However, in most cases, Classic mode will achieve the same result.\n\nTAKE YOUR DRAWING TO THE NEXT LEVEL\n\nDownload Da Vinci Eye today! No one ever regretted sharpening their drawing skills.",

You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Panasonic TV.\n\nThis works on any Panasonic Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. For the latest Panasonic TV models, please enable DMR (Digital Media Renderer) in TV Settings: WIth your remote control, go to: Menu / Setup / Network / Application / DMR: ON\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Panasonic TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Panasonic TV app. It will start looking for your Panasonic TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Panasonic TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Panasonic TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV.

The camera is already good. This app makes the phone as any XS or XS Max. It’s all about software!!!\"\nWritten by Stung68, United States.\n\n\"It’s a great app. It’s as great as the 7+ camera’s Portrait Mode App. Whoever made this app they did a very good job!!!

    "description": "“Nature for Kids,” from the series “Words for Kids,” is a game that promotes the development of children between 2 and 4 years of age.\n\nTogether with your child, you can watch wonderful images of natural objects and phenomena, seasons, fruits and vegetables, berries, flowers, and mushrooms, all while learning their names! \n\nThe carefully selected photographs will not only help a child learn the names of various natural objects and phenomena, but also expose him or her to the remarkable beauty of the world in which we live!\n\nAfter the child has looked through all the flashcards, he or she can take a fun quiz to see how many of the words he or she knows. Regardless of the number of correct answers given, and of stars earned, the child's developing skills will be fostered by enthusiastic applause and floating balloons!\n\nThe educational flashcards for tots are divided into the following categories: berries, fruits, vegetables, flowers, mushrooms, the environment (sea, island, forest, river, mountain, etc.), the seasons, and natural phenomena (rain, rainbow, sunset, lightning, etc.). \n\nOne important feature makes this educational app stand out from the rest: instead of drawings, which are not always easy to identify, the child will see beautiful, colorful photographs of each object and phenomenon. \n\nClearly, it is not so easy to show real live lightning, rainbow or erupting volcano to a child. This educational app allows the child to “see” many natural objects and phenomena as they appear in reality, while allowing parents to tell the child more about them. \n\nDoes the youngster have an older brother or sister in grade school? They can also use this educational game! Besides English, this app also supports the German, Russian and Ukrainian languages. \n\nWhile playing with flashcards in a foreign language, a school-age child can effortlessly learn many new words with which to surprise their foreign language teachers and classmates. An A+ is sure to follow! \n\nIn order to use this educational app, the youngster does not need to be able to read. The simple interface and spoken clues allow even the youngest of children to play and learn independently!\n\nExperience has shown that children love to look through a series of colorful pictures with sounds, and they will ask to see them again and again. According to Glenn Doman, an American physical therapist and the founder of The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, participating in these kinds of educational activities (for 5-10 minutes a day) stimulates the development of various regions in the brain. As a result, the child's photographic memory takes shape, the child develops much faster than his or her peers, and, beginning at infancy, the child gains access to a world of encyclopedic knowledge. \n\nThe main point, in which Doman is undoubtedly correct, is that the younger a child, the more easily he or she can absorb new knowledge. It's important to make use of this ability while it's available!\n\nThe app can be used as a supplementary teaching aid in foreign language instruction. Supported languages: English, Spanish, French, German, Russian, Polish, Ukrainian.",

If that does not help, please give us a chance to help you by dropping a mail to info@video-tv-cast.com instead of leaving a negative comment on the App Store.

    "description": "Instant Z-Scores For All The Paediatric Cardiology Parameters You Review Everyday.\n\nCardio Z has been developed by the experienced Paediatric Cardiology team at Evelina Children's Hospital, London, UK in collaboration with the technology company UBQO. The application makes it easy to calculate Z-scores and centiles for the many cardiac and paediatric measurements that are made in normal clinical practice. Cardio Z distils a wealth of clinical research parameters into a single accessible format.\n\nZ–scores and centiles are a means of expressing how far a measurement is above (positive Z-score) or below (negative Z-score) the average for the size or age of a patient. They are particularly important in assessing and monitoring growing patients, from fetal life though to adulthood.\n\nHealth professionals need to be able to access the normal ranges for cardiac parameters at every age and size, and cross-checking of measurements can be time-consuming and inconvenient. Cardio Z will prove invaluable for both clinicians working directly in Paediatric Cardiology, and those who work in other fields of Paediatrics.\n\nCardio Z allows users to access Z-scores without the need for an internet connection, or the requirement to input the same data in multiple calculators. Users can define their own settings so that they can be sure that their use of z-scores is consistent over time, whilst still allowing flexibility for the experienced clinician. Comprehensive guidance is available ensuring that measurements are consistent with those of the original research, allowing valid comparisons.\n\nCardio-Z creates a summary of all z-scores for each patient, which can then be saved, e-mailed or printed. Simple, reliable and time-saving.\n\nFULL LIST OF FEATURES:\n\n- Cardio Z allows calculation of z-scores of:\n- Height, weight, BMI and head circumference\n- Clinic blood pressure, with calculation of a user-defined 'target centile' blood pressure\n- Echocardiographic measurements of most cardiac structures, including valves, chambers, vessels and coronary arteries\n- Fetal echocardiographic measurements, using gestational age, femur length or biparietal diameter as size reference\n- M-mode echocardiography, including TAPSE\n- Pulsed wave velocities, including E/E' ratio and E/A ratio\n- Tissue Doppler velocities and time intervals. Including Isovolumetric Contraction Time (IVCT), Isovolumetric Relaxation Time (IVRT), Ejection Time and Myocardial Performance Index\n- Discriminant scores for neonatal aortic stenosis with borderline left ventricle\n- ECG parameters (2nd and 98th centiles) and corrected QT interval calculation\n\nEXTRA FEATURES:\n\n- Guidance tips for measurements, including diagrams and notes of the methods of the original researchers\n- Centiles, as well as z-scores, displayed for all parameters\n- No need to re-enter height and weight: baseline data only needs to be entered once\n- Generation of a .pdf summary which can be saved, e-mailed or printed\n- Saved patient Z-score summaries can be accessed and edited at a later date\n- Short-cut keys for frequently used parameters\n- Body surface area calculator can be defined to use the same algorithms as the original research\n- Cardio Z reduces the inconvenience of making Z-score calculations, and improves the correct application of this important clinical tool. The App is not a substitute for clinical judgement or institutional policies, thus it should complement and not replace normal procedures for making clinical decisions.  \n\nWe hope you enjoy using Cardio Z!",

    "description": "The good news - you have $2,000 in cash, and licenses to legally trade. The bad? You owe $5,500 to Dishonest Harry, a not-too-friendly loan shark, interest is piling up, he'll be visiting you soon for his money, and he owns a chainsaw! Just sayin'. You only have one choice - dive into the world of wholesale trading of weed to make money fast and save your skin!\n\nAs you travel from location to location, a day passes and local prices change. Buy low, sell higher! But beware - Officer Hardass is looking out for you, so get prepared for a stand-off with the cops by visiting the Dope Wars Superstore to tool up for the inevitable confrontation! You can also buy more storage space along the way at the Superstore, so look out for sales and special offers.\n\nAlong the way, special market events will cause prices to rise or fall spectacularly, so be ready for these, this is how you get rich! There are muggers out there, so try to keep unused cash in the bank, earning interest. Other loan sharks can lend you money to solve short-term liquidity crunches, but they'll be after their money soon enough! If you get injured, pop in to see the local doctor at his surgery, but look out - he has no scruples, and you have kidneys. A bad combination.\n\nListen out for the crazy old lady, too. She sure has some wacky things to say, but occasionally, she'll give you a very handy tip off, which is essential to your financial success in Dope Wars. Also, keep an eye out (and cash on hand) for the chance to buy a larger coat. More space, more profit! Good luck my friend, you're sure going to need it!!\n\nThis is the full paid version. The paid version removes ads, allows 15, 60, 90, 120 and 365 day game lengths, shows arrows indicating direction of daily price changes, and adds the powerful RCL 9000 weapon. There is also the ad-supported free-version available, with ads and the 30 day game length.\n\nThis version of Dope Wars is ported directly from the wildly popular version of the PC game, also from Beermat Software. Same great addictive game play, modified for your mobile device!\n\nIf you find any bugs in Dope Wars , or would like to see new features added to Dope Wars, please drop us an email at support@beermatsoftware.com",

    "description": "Take a picture of anything that has words on it, and Voice will read it to you! Updated with cutting-edge technology, Voice will let you listen to all your mail, books, documents, and magazines in seconds. \n\nWe have built this app from the ground up with VoiceOver in mind, so you no longer have to worry about unlabelled buttons and complicated user interfaces.\n\nVoice is as simple as it gets.\n\nHold your phone in front of a document. If it sees the page, it will tell you that \"all 4 corners are visible\". When you're ready, just say the word \"Capture\". Voice will automatically snap a picture. Then say \"read,\" and Voice will read the words aloud to you.\n\nKey Features:\n- New and improved OCR quality! Be amazed at how accurate the app will read your documents. You no longer need to worry about low lighting and bad focus, Voice corrects it automatically and gives you near-perfect readings every time.\n- Voice reads handwritten text! It can read the handwritten text even in cursive with slightly messy handwriting! Almost no other app can do this.\n- Voice control. Now you can take a picture by simply saying \"Capture\" or \"Take picture\". Voice will literally snap a photo at your command. Then simply say the word \"Read\" and Voice will start reading it to you. Right now there are only 2 Voice commands but I will be adding more in future updates.\n- Book mode – reads multiple pages one after another. Just simply keep taking photos. Then when you say \"Read,\" Voice will be able to read them all to you one by one.\n- Automatic language detection! The OCR will automatically find and detect the language of your text, so you can read documents that contain text with multiple languages! If you let VoiceOver do the reading, it can fluently switch between languages. Voice supports more than 50 languages!\n- Field of view report – Just point it at a document. Voice will automatically tell you when all 4 corners of the document are visible.\n- Fully compatible with VoiceOver and made specifically with accessibility in mind.\n- Vertical and horizontal column detection and smart column-based reading- ex: newspapers.\n- Adjustable speaking rate. Just customize it to your liking in the app Settings.\n- PREMIUM FEATURE: For $4.99 per month, you can get access to 180 of the highest quality text-to-speech reading Voices on the planet, crafted using artificial intelligence and deep learning technology. These premium Voices are available in 41 languages and are updated every day to improve the quality and delivery of the sound. You can get access to this by separately purchasing a subscription to Voice Pro.\n\n\nSome Tips: \n- This app works only when connected to the internet.\n- Make sure your phone isn't on silent and your volume is all the way up (or enough for you to hear the voice).",

    "description": "Remember being told there is a monkey that can write the works of Shakespeare, solve integrals and intubate a patient?  Well, we’ve captured this monkey and put him to work for you in this powerful app.  \n\nIntubating Monkey (TM) is a collection of the most useful information and anesthesia tools you will find anywhere.  Formulas, tables, and calculators for all the major problems an anesthesiologist will face in and out of the OR.  There are calculators for beginning residents such as the LMA and endotracheal size and depth calculator.  For senior residents there is page for ABG analysis and sizing double lumen tubes.  Were you ever unsure what fiberscope fit in an ETT or DLT?  It’s here.  If one participates in traumas there is the Glasgow Coma scale calculator.  There are charts for APGARs, normal pediatric vital signs, hemodynamic parameters, and fluid maintenance.  There is a table for induction medications and dosages, inhalational agents, herbal medication interactions, ACLS and drugs for life-threatening emergencies.  This app has gotten rid of the fluff and only presents the stuff you really need when you have to know the answer now.\n\nMore complex functions include allowable blood loss and calculated blood loss analysis, GFR calculations and sodium correction for hyponatremia.  If you are involved in cardiac anesthesia the drug infusion calculator makes determining infusion rates as simple as selecting ng/kg/min, mcg/kg/min or mg/kg/min on a dial.  If you want to run any other medication, like Remifenanil, just dial in the settings and you have the rate.\n\nThis app has something for everyone at all levels of training and practice.  Put the Intubating Monkey to work for you!",

    "description": "Asbestos registers, reports and management plans made easy!\n\nSalient features\n\n1. Easy to use -\nCreated by industry veterans who were using paper forms with a digital camera, this software had to be easy to use so they could effectively work whilst on site.\n\n2. Customisable branding -\nReports will show with your company information and branding\n\n3. Automatic report generation -\nCollating all the asbestos locations onsite into a report was a time-consuming task.  With Asbestos Manager, generating a report in .doc format is as simple as pressing a button!  If you need to make any changes, you can do so before sending the report to a client.\n\n4. Reduce time on-site and in the office -\nNo need to juggle pens, paper and a camera.  Just use a smart phone or a tablet to take a photo and log all information necessary about each asbestos location.  As you’re leaving site, select ‘generate report’ and the asbestos register and maintenance plan will be created for you, eliminating time spent typing in the office.\n\n5. Less mistakes -\nBy following our set process to log every asbestos location, you can’t arrive back at your office thinking “I forgot to take a photo of that” or think “which location was that photo taken at?”.  Every asbestos location entered into Asbestos Manager follows a set process, drastically reducing the potential for errors.\n\n6. Increase profitability\nAsbestos Registers and Management Plans can be time consuming to make.  If you’re spending 5 hours onsite, then 4 hours in the office afterwards and charging accordingly, you could implement Asbestos Manager and cut your hours to 4-5 hours onsite, with less than 20 minutes in the office afterwards (including billing).  Not only do you eliminate the time in the office, you can still charge the same as what you did before!\n\n7. Works while offline\nIf you work in remote locations, or in buildings where phone reception isn’t available, Asbestos Manager will still be there working with you.  It will collect all the information on your device, and as soon as you get back into service, it will sync with your cloud database, backing up and sending all the information into safe storage.\n\n8. No lost data\nHave you ever had a computer break, taking your data with it?\nHave you ever tried to get information off a disc, only for it to say ‘files corrupted?’.\nAre you sick of constantly backing up everything you save in case the power goes out?\nNo need to worry about any of this with Asbestos Manager.  It saves all asbestos locations instantly after collection, and when connected to the internet, automatically backs it up in safe online ‘cloud’ storage.  \nThat means, if you’re out of battery on your device, use another!  If your computer breaks, just log in on a new one.  Your data will still be there, just as you left it.\n\n9. Easily update old reports\nWhen it’s time to update an existing asbestos register and management plan, simply go to the existing site with Asbestos Manager, and update each location with new photos and change any information required.  At the end of the update, simply press ‘generate report’ and you have an updated report.  Easy!\n\n10. Online access for client reports and management plans\nOnce a report is generated, simply share the link with your client and they will be able to access their report at anytime, anywhere.  No more reprinting or re sending reports to clients, making it easier for you and most importantly them.\n\nSUBSCRIPTION TERMS:\n\n• Subscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off in the user's Account Setting after purchase\n\n• Account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\n\n• Packages are Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum with 1 month period of auto renewable subscription, please note. \n\n• Payment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\n\nRead our full Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy at\nhttp://beta.asbestosmanager.com.au/privacyPolicy",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year. \n  \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves or a White Balance picker. The Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows or sharpen your photo, among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. Use our built-in RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and keep using the tools you are already familiar with.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nEVERYTHING INCLUDED - no IAPs\nCamera+ 2 works great on iPhone and iPad. Use the same tools consistently across all your devices, and take advantage of multitasking in iPad. All features are included in your purchase for all platforms - no in-app purchases required.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.\n\nLIGHTBOX\nPhotos taken with Camera+ 2 go to the Lightbox by default. Filter them easily to focus on the ones you want to work on, and use the built-in editors to create the exact look you are aiming for. Save or share the final versions when you are done.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat. Also their support is brilliant, they responded in less than an hour of the query I emailed to them.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

If you encounter issues while using the app, don't hesitate to contact me, I am more than happy to help. \n\nPlease keep in mind that, as the app isn’t officially affiliated with WhatsApp, available features and functionality are subject to change. To keep up with everything, the app has been updated more than 50 times since its release in 2017 - I am always looking for ways to offer new features or improve the existing ones.",

Stream Landscape or Portrait video.\n\nAUDIO\nIf you don't have a separate mic for your streaming setup, you can now use the microphone on your iOS device to stream audio & video.\n\nFRONT CAMERA\nStream a selfie with the front camera support. Switch anytime during the stream with the familiar camera switch button.\n\nTAP TO FOCUS, PINCH TO ZOOM\nControls just like you're used to from the Camera app.\n\nMANUAL CONTROLS\nTake control of the focus, exposure, white balance as you would on a manual DSLR camera.\n\nLOW LATENCY\nStream video over a wired USB connection. This avoids the issue of delay over wifi, as many other solutions suffer from. This is just as fast as a USB webcam!\n\nUSB & WIFI\nChoose the connection type. If you want low latency, use USB, if you'd like portability then use WiFi. WiFi is done using the NewTek™ NDI® protocol, so you can use Camera for OBS Studio with any NewTek™ NDI® compatible receiver.\n\nMULTIPLE DEVICES\nIf you're lucky enough to own multiple iOS devices, use them together and produce a multi-camera stream.\n\nMAC AND PC\nSupports OBS Studio running on macOS and Windows.\n\nYou will need to install the OBS Studio iOS Camera Plugin from our website, or use an NDI compatible receiver to use this app.\n\nFor the best possible experience make sure you device is listed on our website https://obs.camera/docs/faqs/#what-ios-hardware-do-i-need",

    "description": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIt's not easy to outperform ourselves after 11 years of delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features, but we did it! Again!\n\nAlready top in its class, and everybody's favorite go-to tool, GoodReader just got significantly better.\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs when you're on the go with your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nA part of the Pro Pack (*) add-on, this wonderful new feature allows you to split an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): Pro Pack® is a paid add-on, sold separately from inside the app, as an in-app purchase.",

    "description": "Application to mirror the screen and audio of your iPhone or iPad to an Amazon Fire TV. You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Fire TV.\n\nBefore using this application, please go to the Amazon website and install the (free) Mirror Receiver for Fire TV: http://bit.ly/am-firetv\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 2). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Fire TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Fire TV app. It will start looking for your Fire TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the Fire TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Fire TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\nDRM\nSome apps don't allow screen mirroring. For instance Netflix: when you start screen mirroring when running the Netflix app on your iPhone or iPad, the TV screen will turn black. This is a choice that Netflix made, there is nothing that we can do about that.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhen you like the app, please don't forget to give it a positive rating! Thanks in advance from the AirBeamTV development team!\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",
