Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

    "description": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

    "description": "Hey you! Yeah you! Shouldn't you be looking for Camera+ 2 instead? Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots.",

    "description": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription.

    "description": "Build and serve sundaes on the go with this brand-new version of Papa's Freezeria, with gameplay and controls reimagined for iPhone and iPod Touch!\r\n\r\nYou've just started a relaxing summer job at an oceanfront ice cream shop, but things get hectic when all of Papa Louie's customers arrive on the island!  You'll need to whip up delicious Freezer sundaes by pouring ice cream, adding mixables and syrups, blending sundaes, adding whipped cream and toppings, and don't forget the cherry on top for a perfect summertime treat!\r\n\r\nYou'll need to multitask between each area of the restaurant, with new controls designed to work just right in the palm of your hand.  Head to the Order Station to watch for customers waiting in the lobby.  Switch to the Build Station to combine ice cream and mixables for each sundae.  Jump to the Mix Station to mix sundaes until they're blended just right.  Hop to the Top Station to pour whipped cream and toppings before serving the sundae to your picky customers.  Each Station is a hands-on experience, where you'll need to drag, swipe, and tap your way through the sundae-building process.\r\n\r\nKeep your customers happy to earn points and level up.  As your level rises, you'll unlock new toppings for the shop, and new customers will start to visit the Freezeria!  A well-crafted sundae also earns you tips, which you can spend on upgrades and decorations for the lobby!\r\n\r\n** NEW FOR PAPA'S FREEZERIA TO GO**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is redesigned and reimagined for smaller screens, so your fingers won't get in the way of the action!\r\n\r\nCONTROL WITH YOUR THUMBS - You'll switch stations using buttons in the corners of the screen, perfect for your thumbs.  You can also use buttons in the top corners to quickly switch Order Tickets, and you can view all of your Order Tickets in a zoomed-in mode for easy reading.\r\n\r\nBUILD STATION - We've completely redesigned the Build Station for smaller screens.  The Pour Button and Bonus Meter are moved to the side and sized just right for your thumb, so you can watch the meter and tap at the right time without any fingers blocking your view.  When it's time to choose a mixable or a syrup, the entire screen is filled with large buttons so you can easily tap the correct item.\r\n\r\nMIX STATION - We've fine-tuned the Mix Station upgrades to work even better on small touch screens.  Once you purchase the Blend Alarm upgrades, you can drag these large alarms and snap them onto any blender.  Booster Buttons are also large and easy to press, and you can even use multi-touch to boost multiple blenders at once!\r\n\r\nTOP STATION - The Topping Bin carousel from \"Papa's Burgeria To Go!\" is back, which lets you top sundaes in a brand-new way!  Swipe the carousel of Topping Bins to choose the item you want to use, then grab the sundae cup to start pouring toppings evenly across the sundae.  You can also tap a button to switch to placeable items like cherries and cookies.  And with full multi-touch support, you can keep one finger sliding the bins and another tapping on the cup below, so you'll have those sundaes finished in no time!\r\n\r\nNEW INGREDIENTS - We've added a ton of new ingredients that can't be found in the classic or HD versions of the game, including mixables, syrups, whipped cream flavors, and other toppings that you'll unlock as you play the game.  There's over 70 unique ingredients for you to discover!\r\n\r\n**GAME FEATURES**\r\n\r\n- Hands-on ice cream shop in the Papa Louie universe\r\n- All new controls and gameplay designed for smaller screens\r\n- Multi-task between building, mixing, and topping\r\n- Shop to buy upgrades using your in-game tips\r\n- 85 customers to unlock with unique orders\r\n- Challenging Closers and Food Critic\r\n- 120 in-game achievements to earn\r\n\r\n**NOTE FOR iPAD USERS**\r\n\r\nPapa's Freezeria To Go is designed especially for smaller screens.

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",
