As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher. WatchOS 5 recommended.\n\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124?ign-itscg=as10001&ign-itsct=BESTOF_SC18_PT122_US_SI1438574124\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916?ign-itsct=BestOfApps_SC09_PT006_WW%2F&ign-itscg=10000\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/",

It will then load the description and image from Wikipedia so that you check if the recognized disease or pest is correct. \n\nThe plant specific models recognize the most common diseases of the listed plants and provide suggestions for preventing and treating the disease. \n\nYou have access to an extensive lexicon describing measures on how to prevent and treat plant diseases and pests based on biological treatment methods. We list the substances enabling you to find the specific product in your country. \n\nAs an additional help you can use our check list that filters diseases by color and shape. Just push the buttons for color and shape and the system will provide you with a list of possible diseases. You can also filter insects by by category and color. \n\nIn the plants section you can find a list of common diseases and pests for the active plant with specific recommendations. \n\nDue to the large number of possible symptoms, the model can only deliver results with a certain probability, which is also indicated next to the identified disease. In order to increase the accuracy of the model, we are regularly adding new pictures to the model and we plan to update it at least once per year.",

    "description": "“[A] surprising iPhone and Apple Watch bestseller is pushing the boundaries of fiction” - boingboing.net\n“This is the best game on the Apple Watch” - Time.com\n\nLifeline is a playable, branching story of survival against all odds. Using your iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch, you will help Taylor make life or death decisions, and face the consequences together.\n\nAcclaimed writer Dave Justus (Fables: The Wolf Among Us) weaves a gripping interactive story through the aftermath of a crash landing on an alien moon. Taylor is stranded, the rest of the crew are dead or missing, and Taylor’s communicator can only reach you.\n\nLifeline pioneered a new narrative experience enabled by modern devices. This story plays out in real time as Taylor works to stay alive, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free. You can even respond to Taylor directly from your Apple Watch or your iPhone lock screen, without launching into the app.\n\nOr, dive in and jump back to earlier points in the story, and see what happens when you make a different choice. Simple actions can have a profound effect. Complete any single path to restart the story and unlock this mode.\n\nLifeline is a deep, immersive story of survival and perseverance, with many possible outcomes. Taylor is relying on YOU.\n\nNEW in version 1.8: Stick around after the game for a special story epilogue from Dave Justus. For players who have already finished the game, the Bonus Story becomes available under the game options. Witness the events leading up to Lifeline: Silent Night.\n\nInternet connection not required. No in-app purchases and no ads.\n\n\nPraise for Lifeline:\n\n“I’ve played many games that I find engrossing, but Lifeline may be one of the first that changed the way I thought about my daily routine, which leapt off the screen and became a part of my lived experience.” - Eli Cymet, Gamezebo\n\n“I felt an immediate attachment to a fictional character pinging me from a strange galaxy to my wearable.” - Luke Hopewell, Gizmodo Australia\n\n“[P]laying it on the Apple Watch makes you truly feel like you’re exchanging messages with an astronaut via a futuristic transmitter.” - Michael Andronico, Tom’s Guide\n\n“For a few brief hours I cared – really cared – about the fate of a completely fictional character. I don’t think any other game I’ve played has made me feel that way before.” - Matt Thrower, PocketGamer\n\n\nLifeline was created by:\nDave Justus\nMars Jokela\nDan Selleck\nColin Liotta\nJason Nowak\nBen “Books” Schwartz",

    "description": "Visualmed app provides visual infographic based summaries of landmark clinical trials in medicine and other fields of health care. The pace at which new data in medicine is getting published is tremendous and to keep up with it we need a way to quickly access the key points of landmark clinical trials. In order to fill that gap, we came up with Visualmed. The app version of visualmed lets users sort clinical trials based on the field of medicine. For example, if you're looking for landmark trials in cardiology then simply access the cardiology subcategory. Additionally, we have added year based sorting of studies that let users access studies that are published in 2020 or which were published back in the 90s!. The best way to use this app is when you're rounding on your patients. With our search tool, you can quickly put in keywords to access clinical trials on that subject. For example, if you write aspirin the search bar you will obtain access to all landmark clinical trials done on aspirin. The app gets updated with more recent studies every day so make sure to check out the recent tab to access all the latest clinical trials in medicine.",

You can keep receiving calls, in other applications and the sounds are still working. While you are in your moment. OFFTIME and use your phone, the application will send you notifications so you know you are not fulfilling it. Once I used it for more than 30 seconds, the OFFTIME moment is considered canceled \n- Extended OFFTIME programming, to define specific punctual dates.\n - OFFTIME events: you will now be able tu invite your iOS Friends and family to a joint OFFTIME event.

One year is composed of 12 lunar months of around 29 days and 12 hours.\n\nFor every year, our panchang contains more than 340 important date of events and holy festivals in India. It reflects India's culture through the Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian and civil festivals happening all along the year. Nearly all the festivals are illustrated with a colorful image.\n\nThe calendar covers the full 2021 year. It also contains all the information from year 2009.\n\nIt contains all the details about the lunar cycles (Tithi and Karana), the planets (Nakshatra), the moon/sun combinaisons (Yoga), the full moons or purnima, the new moon or amavasaya, ... along with the Sunrise and Sunset timings.\n\nWhat's included:\n- Sun, Thithi and Nakshatra timings for several cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata) and around the World: Paris, London, Geneva, Moscow,New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, Los Angeles, Cape Town, Toronto, Melbourne, Sydney, Tokoy, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Hawaii, St Denis Réunion, Kuweit City, Colombo, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur. The timings are taking the daylight savings into account.\n Panchak for every month\n- At startup, the current month will be displayed, with an emphasis on the current day. Just clic on any day to get all the details about this particular day.\n- Lunar month days\n- Display the details on a day, including: western calendar information (gregorian calendar), Tithi information (moon day name, Shuklapaksh, Krishnapaksh, timings), Nakshatra (name and timings), Sun timings, list of festivals of that day\n- Display Vikram Samwat and Saka Samwat\n- A list of full moon (purnima) and new moon (amavasaya)\n- A list of events and holy festivals, sorted by months, with direct access to any month.\n- A list of government gazetted holidays\n- A very convenient search tool: Just type a word or the part of a word and get the list of all events related to your search.\n- An image for nearly every event\n- A list of major cities for which you want to see the detailed panchang. If your city is not in the list, you just select the closest one.\n\nWith the search tool, you can:\n- Write \"Prad\", you'll get the full list of Pradosh vrat of the year (worship of Lord Shiva, which is observed on the Trayodashi of both the fortnight - Shukla and Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Eka\", you'll get the full list of Ekadashi of the year (Ekadashi occurs on the 11th day of the bright half - called Shukla Paksha and on the 11th of the dark half called Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Chatur\", you'll get the full list of Ganesha and Vinayak Chaturthi of the year\n- Write \"Rohini\" or \"Ashtami\", and so on...\n\nOur calendar complied a Hindu Panchang according to Vedic science and modern outlook.

Great Mini-Games with purpose!:\n\nCompatibility: The App doesn't support iPad2, iPhone 4s, iPad Mini1, iPod5 with iOS9\n\n1) Kitten Hide&Seek - encourages focus and attention.\n2) Paw Painting - creativity unleashed! Mix red, yellow, blue to get every imaginable colour - your child will learn realistic paint mixing, then come up with your own masterpiece using a paw print or a standard brush.\n3) Mouse & Cheese - Memorize where the zones are to sneak mouse past little kitten over to the cheese. Or just have some laughs seeing what happens when little kitten catches the mouse!\n4) Bed Trampoline - Discover all little kitten's hidden tricks and moves!\n5) Animal Puzzle - Educational 'mix and match' funny animal combinations to earn biscuits that you can then feed to your little kitten.\n6) Feeding - Each time you play a mini-game you receive cat food snacks, children love feeding the little kitten and watching it licking its lips and purr after a good feed!\n7) Cat-in-the-box - Educational 'hand-eye coordination' mini-game \n8) Balloon Popping - can you discovered all the different shapes?!\n\nNot using any text menus, the game can be easily navigated by young children.

Using G.L.O.P.P. (Gluon Liquid Omega-Phased Plasma), the maniacal Mech Morphix has transformed the creatures of New York City into an army of bloodthirsty mutants. In Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project, Duke must deploy W.I.N. (Weapons, Insults and Name-Calling) to rid the city of goo-based bad guys, and return peace and tranquility to The City That Never Sleeps. \n\nOriginally released to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Duke Nukem in 2002, Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project blends together the best elements of Duke Nukem 3D and the best 2D sidescrolling of the first two games in the series, Duke Nukem and Duke Nukem II. \n\nFrom babes, bombs and Battlelords, to goggles, guns and Gargoyles, revisit Duke's dynasty with these re-released classics. Return to a time when the King Of Action didn't need regenerative health or auto-aim - a time when action games were actually about action, an era when heroes had the strength to carry as many guns as they wanted and use as many cheats as they needed. \n\nCelebrate Duke Nukem's 20th anniversary in sunshade-wearing, quick-quipping style with a title that - alongside the re-release of Duke's first two adventures - recognizes a series that's had a tremendous impact on an entire industry, and represents the best of Duke in a way that no other game could.\n\n***   Key Features:   ***\n\nA Good Day To Duke: Rip 'em a new one with 9 brand new weapons, including the G.L.O.P.P. Ray, Pipe Bomb, Pulse Cannon and the almighty \"press-to-kill-everything\" X-3000.\n\nNew York, New York:  8 huge levels across various regions of New York City: Rooftop Rebellion, Chinatown Chiller, Metro Madness, Unholy Underworld, Fearsome Factory, Tanker Trouble and Deviant Drilling. And the last level is, let's say, a little out of town. \n\nEvil Has A Snout: Blast, jump and smart-ass through more than 25 enemies, including Pig Cops, Gator Grunts, and Roachoids.\n\nWhat Are You Waitin' For?: A potent blend of old school gameplay and smooth 3D visuals, Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project brings together the best of both Dukes for the ultimate Duke Nukem experience.\n\nLet's rock!",

    "description": "Looking for an app than does more than just track your sleep, remind you not to drink too much coffee, or play rainforest sounds?  Or interested in taking a custom length nap?  Developed by a Certified Clinical Sleep Educator and Licensed Sleep Technologist of 25+ years, the Sleep On Cue™ app gives you an active way to work on your sleep without pills or gimmicks.  Based on Australian sleep research of Intensive Sleep Retraining, this app is totally different than all other sleep apps.  Here's how it works:\n\n\nFor sleep training:\n\nUse the Sleep On Cue™ app around bedtime, following any rough night of sleep.  Plug in your earbud headphones, lie down in bed with your iPhone gently held in your hand.  You will hear a series of tones (adjust the volume to keep them very faint).  A slight shake of the phone after each faint tone informs the Sleep On Cue™ app that you are still awake.  When you stop responding, the Sleep On Cue™ app knows you have fallen asleep.  Following the protocol of Intensive Sleep Retraining, your phone vibrates to get you up.  \n\nNext, the Sleep On Cue™ app asks if you THINK you fell asleep, then tells you if you are correct or not.  Over time, this process can greatly improve your ability and awareness of falling asleep.  The app then prompts you to leave the bed for a couple of minutes, return, and repeat.  An hour or so around bedtime (again, following any rough night of sleep) can be all it takes to restore confidence in your sleep.  Sleep training can help you reduce your need for sleeping pills or alcohol for sleep (with guidance from your doctor).  And after each sleep training session, a summary graph shows your progress during the sleep trials.  This graph can be saved and shared (e.g., with your doctor).\n\n\nFor taking a nap:\n\nThe Sleep On Cue™ app lets you enter the amount of time you have for a nap, as well as how long you want to sleep in your nap time.  For a nap, Sleep On Cue™ uses the same call/response (faint tone/slight shake) system, but once you fall asleep and stop responding to the tones, the app silently keeps going.  Then, when the amount of time you entered to actually sleep during your nap is up, Sleep On Cue™ vibrates to wake you up.  It's that easy and convenient! \n\nThere is even a \"500 minute\" setting in the Custom Nap module that can be used if you just want to hear the tones while you fall asleep or back to sleep during the night.  The tones are very calm and soothing!\n\n\nSo whether you want to do some sleep training around bedtime to get your sleep back on track after a rough night, or you simply need an afternoon nap, the Sleep On Cue™ app is your way to better sleep health.  You can read all about the background research on our website www.sleeponQ.com.\n\nNo ads or IAPs - just need your earbud headphones and your iPhone (will not work on iPod or iPad).\n\n\nLearn to Sleep On Cue™!\n\n\nDisclaimer\nSleep On Cue™ is meant for personal interest and education only.  It is not meant to replace advice of a medical professional or to alter any health treatment recommendations from a professional healthcare provider.  Always talk to your doctor about your health concerns, including your sleep.  Do not drive or perform any activity that requires vigilance for safety if you are excessively sleepy.

    "description": "Use Quantum Physics to Split Your Universe -- It's the Ultimate Decision-Maker\n\nTHIS IS THE ORIGINAL!\n  • An App Store \"Top Paid App\"\n  • An App Store \"Staff Favorite\"\n  • Endorsed by famous physicists\n\nAnd recently featured in:\n  • \"Something Deeply Hidden\" best-selling book by Sean Carroll\n  • \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast\n  • \"This American Life\" podcast\n\n\n\"According to quantum mechanics, every observation brings new universes into existence. But these universes have been completely useless to us -- until now! Universe splitter helps guarantee that there's at least one version of you who has made all the right choices.\"\n    -- Sean Carroll, physicist at Caltech and best-selling author\n\n\"The functioning of this app is in complete agreement with the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.\"\n   -- Garrett Lisi, PhD, Theoretical Physics\n\n\nScientists say that every quantum event plays out simultaneously in every possible way, with each possibility becoming real in a separate universe. But that was just an abstract concept... until now! Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved",

Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

    "description": "GeoShred Play Version 5, is an exciting update, now with In-App-Purchases for GeoSWAM instruments on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater.\n\nWith GeoShred Play, everyone can shred using the new diatonic playing surface!  You can Shred the Blues and never hit a wrong note.  Slide your finger in any direction and let the magic happen using a scale that fits perfectly against a backing track.  Seamlessly move between fretless and diatonic modalities in a magical musical way using our isomorphic and diatonic playing surface and groundbreaking intelligent pitch rounding.\n\nGeoShred Play is a play-only version of the award-winning GeoShred musical instrument for iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch. GeoShred Play can be used to perform GeoShred Pro presets.\n\nIt's a great way to get started with GeoShred, AND it can be upgraded to ALL of the powerful GeoShred Pro features like preset editing, AUv3 plugin support, MIDI/MPE, and setlist editing.  GeoShred Play can also purchase GeoSWAM IAP instruments. \n\nGold Medal Winner of the 2019 Denny Award, winner of a 2019 Guthman New Musical Instrument Award, and winner of the 2017 Electronic Musician Editor's Choice Award as \"one of the most innovative, groundbreaking products to emerge in the past twelve months\".  \n\nGeoShred’s performance surface with “almost magic” pitch rounding algorithms is coupled with a model of the physics of strings. It’s a fusion of Jordan Rudess’ performance concepts and moForte’s powerful, modeled guitar/effects based on the Physical Modeling research of Dr. Julius O. Smith III of Stanford/CCRMA. \n\nGeoShred Play Features Include:\n• A fluidly expressive playing surface + a Physically modeled guitar\n• A diatonic keyboard where every key on the screen is in the scale.\n• Support for backing tracks\n• 3D touch on devices that support 3D touch.\n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus support.\n\n---\n \nPraise for the GeoShred family of apps: \n\n“GeoShred is brilliant- it’s a real instrument.” – Eddie Jobson\n\n“A fantastic new invention which is going to revolutionize the way music is played, expressed and learned! “GeoShred” is one of the foremost best musical inventions I’ve had the pleasure to experience in recent years. Definitely 5 stars out of 5! GIGANTASTIVISSIMO…..R…A…Z !!!!!” – Patrick Moraz\n\n“That’s just nuts. You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.  It would mean a lot to us if you could leave your positive review on the App Store and If you have any questions about GeoShred we would love to hear from you at our support email address: support@moforte.com \n\n---\nMinimum Requirements:  iOS 11.4 or better is required for AUv3 support and GeoSWAM instruments.\n***Note: The GeoSWAM instruments can ONLY be performed from the GeoShred keyboard or MPE controllers.\n***Note: Unfortunately, due to App Store limitations, previously purchased instrument IAPs can not be applied to a purchase of the collection IAP. \n***Note: The Pro upgrade is to the functionality of GeoShred Pro.  The app is still GeoShred Play, but it has all the Pro features and is identical to GeoShred Pro",

Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate. However, in some countries those times may be not exact. In this case, please refer to the official islamic institutions or mosques in your country and adjust manually the prayer times in the application settings.\n\nSalatuk supports currently 3 languages : Arabic, English and French.\n\nTips for a better usage\n-----------------------------\n\n1- In order to refresh the prayer alarms, make sure to open the application once a week. Please do so also when you change your location or timing (summer time).\n\n2- The prayer alarms corresponds to 2 or 4 Takbeerats.

The key is to eat your \"Ugliest\" Frog BEFORE you do anything else, and without taking too much time to think about it.\n\nThe Truth About Frogs\nMark Twain once said that if the first thing you do each morning is eat a live frog, you can go through the day with the satisfaction of knowing that it’s probably the worst thing you'll have to do all day long.\n\nYour \"Frog\" is your biggest, most important task. It's the one you are most likely to procrastinate on, even dread. Yet, it is also the one task that can have the greatest positive impact on your life and create positive results immediately.\n\nWith that in mind, \"Eat That Frog,” the iPhone app, has been specifically designed and developed to ensure that your biggest priorities are handled with the urgency and focus required to make you most effective in your business and personal life. \n\nEach day, you'll be impressed with the momentum created from tackling your most difficult tasks, and at the end of each week and month, you'll be amazed to see just how much you've completed!\n\nWhy use Eat That Frog?  \nThere is no denying that it is our ability to focus on priorities and manage our time effectively which separates the high-achievers. \n\nTo that end, Eat That Frog! helps you to quickly establish and track your most important and impactful tasks throughout the each day.\n\nHOW TO USE:\nYou can create as many tasks/Frogs as you like. However, there is a catch, you can only ACTIVATE ONE FROG AT A TIME. \n\nNOTE: This is NOT a ToDo app - it's a procrastination killer that enables pure focus. \nFind out why this is the methodology used by the most productive people in the world. \n\nLearn more at www.briantracy.com\nFEATURES:\n- Establish as many custom Tasks/Frogs as you like!\n- Track your daily Frog and add required steps to keep you on target\n- Establish estimated completion dates for each Frog!\n- Easy to understand and clean user interface\n- ANIMATION and SOUND! \n- Motivate! Upon setup or each Frog task item, you get to write WHY you must complete the task \n- Track each Frog over multiple days if necessary\n- Chart both completion percentages and status\n- Email chart data!\n- Select up to four unique Frog ribbits\n- Includes Badge reminder!\n\n-----\n\"Eat That Frog! is simple, creative, fun to use and most importantly effective.\"\nChelsea S.\n \nMORE:\nFind other leading personal development apps from Equilibrium Enterprises: The Habit Factor® and Bucket List Pro",

Spectra is a lightweight music & audio visualizer app that allows you to select and visualize audio in realtime, right on your phone or mac. Want to export your visualization? We have you covered. Simply click the \"Create Video\" button from within the app. No longer do you need expensive software to create those beautiful animations you've seen on the internet. Want to customize the background image or put a logo in the center? We made that available as well. In fact, you can customize just about all aspects of the visualizer. You can even import audio files from apps like iMessage or Mail using the share sheet. We want to keep improving the app so If you have any suggestions, be sure to leave a review and tell us what feature you're missing!\n\nThe features:\n• Amazing, 60fps realtime visualization for any audio file, iTunes music (not Apple Music), or Spotify song\n• Video exporting of your audio visualization (does not support Spotify)\n• Custom background image\n• Background presets\n• Background effects\n• Custom logo image\n• Visualizer customization\n• Particle customization\n• Video export settings\n• Video animation options\n• Presets\n• More to come!!!\n\nHere's how it works:\nThe sound we hear is made up of many frequencies. The visualizer decomposes the audio input into its frequencies and displays the lower frequencies at the top/left of the audio spectrum and the higher frequencies at the bottom/right of the spectrum. This can create some cool-looking shapes that all correspond to the currently-playing audio track!\n\nWhether you're a producer that wants to see the frequency range of their song, an audiophile, or someone who wants to take a deeper look into their music, this app is definitely for you.",

    "description": "With Toca Kitchen Sushi, you’re the chef of a busy seaside restaurant. Customers come in, and you decide what they’re going to eat. Feel like slicing up squid, asparagus, and candy canes, and rolling it all up into a cone of seaweed? Go right ahead. Want to make stars and hearts of watermelon and mix them with fish and hot peppers? Make the roundest rice ball? You’ve got great tools for that right at your fingertips. With a fantastic array of ingredients, condiments, tools, serving dishes and some hidden surprises, you’re set for some serious play. \n\nOnce you’re finished cooking up something unexpected for your customers—it could even be totally gross if you want—sit back and see how they react. That might be the most surprising thing of all!\n\nFEATURES\n\n- Greet your customers, then head to the fridge to see all your fresh ingredients. Choose from rice, tuna, avocado, asparagus, squid, salmon, pepper, salami, radish, candy canes (no joke!), ginger, potato, tofu, shrimp and many, many more. If you’d rather stick to just veggies, switch to the vegan setting!\n\n- The shape machine is 1,000 light years ahead of a plain old rice cooker. Using the control panel, you can form any ingredient into different shapes, like an oval, square, or even a flower!\n\n- The rolling mat is where everything comes together. Whether it’s a sheet of seaweed, tofu or lettuce, you can roll up your ingredients into sushi, funky cones, giant burritos, you name it.\n\n- Want your food a bit well-done? Crank up the temperature on the frying pan and see what happens. \n\n- Hit the cutting board to slice up your ingredients or your sushi rolls. Your blade is masterful—it can cut through anything, like a huge fish or hard salami!\n\n- Once you’ve prepared your meal, it needs the perfect plate. Get artistic about it, arrange the food in perfect patterns, or make a huge, messy pile; even decorate with funny stickers. Do something extra and you may get a big reaction from your customers!\n\n- The dining counter is where your customers finally get to see your culinary creation, grab their chopsticks and dig in. Will their eyes brighten in delight, or will they make a grossed-out face?\n\nSo, what will you serve today?\n\n\nAbout Us:\nToca Boca creates digital toys and other playful products for kids around the world.

As buttons are pressed in the app the total counted cards are recorded.  This is then adjusted to take into account cards that aren't recorded.  A “total cards dealt” number is determined which is then divided by 52 to represent total decks dealt.  This number is then used in the \"True Count\" calculation.\n\nYou can adjust the number of decks in the shoe by going to the info screen.\n\n** Card Counting Methods **\n\nFor each strategy press the button that contains the face value of the cards as they are drawn from the deck.  Depending on the strategy and on the value of the card the button will either add or subtract 1 or 2 from the \"Running Count\".\n\nHi-Lo  - Low cards 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 (add 1 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q, K and A (subtract 1 from total).\n\nHi-Op  I - Low cards 3, 4, 5, and 6 (add 1 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 1 from total).\n\nHi-Op  II - Low cards 2, 3, 6 and 7 (add 1 to total) 4 and 5 (add 2 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 2 from total).\n\nOmega II - Low cards 2 and 3 (add 1 to total) 4, 5 and 6 (add 2 to total).  High cards 10, J, Q and K (subtract 2 from total).\n\nAfter a shuffle the new deck button should be pressed to set the tally back to 0.\n\n** Basic Strategy **\n\nAs most blackjack players know if you stick to the Basic Strategy for blackjack the house has a small advantage.  But if you can keep count of the number of High and Low ranked cards in the pack you can gain a small advantage.  You do this by betting more when there are more High cards still in the deck.  \n\nYou have an advantage when more high cards are in the deck particularly near the end of the shoe.\n\nThis small advantage, around 1%, over a long period of time can result in huge wins.\n\nDisclaimer: This app is intended for home use entertainment purposes only. At many casinos it is deemed illegal to use an electronic device with the intention of gaining an advantage over the casino. By choosing accept you agree not to use this app for illegal purposes.
