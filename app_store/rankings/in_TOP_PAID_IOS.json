    "description": "TV Mirror for Fire TV is the easy screen mirror app to share your iPhone or iPad screen on your Fire TV. It's the most advanced screen mirroring solution with zero delay and the highest screen quality.\n\nMirror photos, videos, games, websites, apps, presentations, documents and spreadsheets on Fire TV.\n\n* Supported Fire TVs: Fire TV Box+Stick, Fire TV Cube and all other devices of the Fire TV Family.\n\n* Supported TVs: Insignia TV and Toshiba TV with Fire TV Edition\n\n* Your iPhone/iPad and your Fire TV must be connected to the same wifi to enable screen mirroring. Please do not use VPN, Proxy, VLANS and Subnets.\n\n* Latency is supreme (below 1 second) when you have good wifi network conditions\n\n* No hidden subscriptions or costs\r\n\n* Sound is not yet support yet, but we are working on it. Please use Bluetooth speakers as a workaround.\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store. Many thanks in advance from the development & support team.\n\n\nDisclaimer: This app is not affiliated with Amazon or any other trademark mentioned here.",

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

Just navigate to your favorite website and send the embedded video with a single tap to your Amazon Fire TV. The discovered video will be shown below the browser. A tap on the video link will send it to your Amazon Fire TV immediately. Streaming personal media from your device is also supported.\n\n\n>>> Important Notes\n\n* The app only works with a Amazon Fire TV or Fire TV Stick.\n\n* iTunes movies, Flash video and DRM protected videos like Amazon Prime, Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, DirecTV, Xfinity, HBO now are not supported!\n\n* The app streams only the video part of a website and not the whole website content (No screen or tab mirroring!). \n\n* Sometimes it is necessary to play the video on your iPad or iPhone first before it gets discovered by the app for streaming. It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store. We will try to add support for that website as soon as possible. \n\n\n>>> PRO FEATURES\n\n* Remote Playbar: A remote control that allows you to fast forward or rewind videos while browsing. It syncs across all your iPads & iPhones that are connected to the same Fire TV. So your video can be controlled by different users in the same room.\n\n* Personal Media: Cast unlimited personal photos, videos and music directly from your device or from cloud services like iCloud and Dropbox. \n\n* Ad-Blocker + No Sponsoring Ads: The Pro app version has no ads and the Ad-Blocker blocks ads & popups on most websites that you visit. You can update, enable/disable ad-blocking at any time in the settings. \n\n* Bookmarks: Save unlimited website bookmarks. Synchronize and transfer them between different TV Cast apps and iOS devices by using backup and restore via iCloud.\n\n* Desktop Mode: Change the browser user-agent and cloak your iPhone/iPad as a desktop PC to load the desktop website instead of a mobile website. Please note that this will NOT enable video casting on websites that serve Flash videos in desktop mode.\n\n* Change Homepage: Set your personal homepage in the settings.\n\n\n>>> A MESSAGE FROM THE DEVELOPERS\n\nCountless websites have been reported to us and we already support more than 90% of all videos on the internet.

Rich output generated by running code, including HTML, images, video, and plots, is embedded in the notebook, which makes it a complete and self-contained record of a computation.\n\nEach notebook consists of a sequence of cells, each representing either a narrative text in a form of markdown text or HTML, or a piece of code with its text or media output. This makes notebooks both human-readable documents containing the analysis description and the results (figures, tables, etc), as well as executable documents which can be run to perform data analysis. You can use Jupyter notebook as a document with executable code in it, or simply as a playground for data manipulation and experiments.",

    "description": "Lalitha Sahasranama Stotram is a text from Brahmanda Purana. It is a sacred text to the Hindu worshippers of the Goddess Lalita Devi, i.e. the Divine Mother, in the form of her power, Shakti. Lalita is the Goddess of bliss, an epithet for Shiva's wife Goddess Parvati. Etymologically, \"Lalita\" means \"She Who Plays\". In the root form (vyutpatti), the word \"Lalita\" means \"spontaneous\" from which the meaning \"easy\" is derived and from there-forth the word implicitly extends to \"play\". It is supposedly one of the most complete stotras which can be recited for complete salvation.\n\nThis sahasranama is held as a sacred text for the worship of the \"Divine Mother\", Lalitha, and is also used in the worship of Durga, Parvati, Kaali, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Bhagavathi, etc. A principal text of Shakti worshippers, it names her various attributes, and all these names are organised in the form of a hymn. This sahasranama is used in various modes for the worship of the Divine Mother. Some of the modes of worship are parayana (Recitations), archana, homa etc.\n\nThe sloka is organised based on the five works (pancha krtyam). They are creation (srishti), protection (sthithi), destruction (samhAram), hiding (thirOdhAnam) and blessing (anugraham). Devi herself has been described as \"pancha krtya parAyanA\" in the sloka and the five tasks\n\n***Lalitha Sahasranama Stotram application contains list of features as follows*** \n\n# 1 .

The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you.

Play 40 different levels, and build bridges over deep valleys, canals, and rivers. Stress tests reveal whether the bridge you build can withstand the daily stress of continual use from cars, trucks and, more recently, super-heavy tank trucks.\n\nYou can choose from a range of materials for each individual bridge, such as wood, steel, cables, or concrete pillars. Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realise your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system! \n\nAwesome Add-Ons: SlopeMania & Trains\n\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes! The 24 tricky, never-before-seen levels will have you using sloping lanes to overcome the massive height differences.

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",

Taylor is stranded, the rest of the crew are dead or missing, and Taylor’s communicator can only reach you. \n\nA totally unique experience enabled by modern devices, this story plays out in real time. As Taylor works to stay alive, notifications deliver new messages throughout your day. Keep up as they come in, or catch up later when you’re free.

Simple actions can have a profound effect.

Vanquish dragons and bag their treasures or build a canal to help barren grain fields bloom once more.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Available languages: English, German, French, Dutch, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese\n- Original \"Settlers of Catan\" rule set\n- Update 4.0+: Synchronous online multiplayer games\n- Smart computer opponents with individual strategies\n- Scrollable game board including zoom option \n- Freely combinable game settings \n- Game statistics\n- Comprehensive tutorial\n- Seafarers LITE: New scenario \"The 4 Islands\" and two additional game variants\n- Cities and Knights LITE: Test the new expansion in the scenario “The first Island”\n- 3 different graphic sets to choose from\n\n\n***** \nCatan FAQ: \n\nQuestion: An expansion seems gone after an update or reinstallation of Catan or after restoring the device? \nAnswer: Don’t worry! Your initial purchase is already saved in your iTunes account. You can restore your InApp purchases by selecting the restore-option in the Catan IAP menu. \n\nQuestion: I lost my campaign progress after reinstalling, updating or restoring my device. Is there any way to restore it? \nAnswer: When saved games can’t be automatically restored, we’ve integrated a cheat code: In the campaign mode go to select player and enter „CatanWarp*“ (* = 1–15) as your player name and confirm. Exit the game via the home button and restart it. The campaign can now be continued from the specified level number (1–15). Levels up to the specified number will be unlocked in the custom game mode as well. \n\nQuestion: Are dice rolls really random? \nAnswer: Of course! All dice rolls are 100% random and not modified in any way. We’re avid Catan players ourselves. We’ve played the iOS version hundreds of times while developing the program. There have been times when we won and lost a few games in a row because of the dice - just like when playing the board game! \n\n*****\nQuestions or suggestions for improvements: \nMail to ios@usm.de \nWe are looking forward to your feedback! \n\nFor more information on news and updates: www.usmgames.com \nor visit us on www.facebook.com/UnitedSoftMedia and twitter.com/USM_News \n\n*****",

    "description": "iShala is an Indian music mobile app that effectively replaces a tabla machine, a lehra player and an electronic tanpura. It is an ideal tool for anyone practicing Indian classical music, or just wishing to jam along virtual Indian musicians on any other musical style. \n\nFeatured instruments are Tabla, Harmonium, Swarmandal and Tanpura. You can select to play one or all of them at wish, with Tabla and Harmonium always in sync. You can also play Swarmandal manually, by plucking its strings at wish.\n\niShala includes over 50 rhythmic cycles, melodies in more than 110 ragas and 7 different tempos. You can now also create your own ragas and fine-tune each of their notes at microtones (shruti) level. Possible combinations are thus nothing short of endless!\n\nAudiobus and IAA compatible. Now also with VoiceOver support for visually-impaired users.",

Lumy shows you the weather information like cloudiness and temperature for the next 2 days to plan things out.\n\nLumy notification is interactive and dynamic. It comes with the realtime countdown to the notified photographic time. Also, you can snooze or postpone the notification for the next day.\n\nWith the filter option, you can configure the information only relevant to you. You can get Sunrise, Sunset, Morning and Evening golden hours, Astronomical, Nautical, Civil Twilight for your current location, or any locations worldwide. Except for the weather information, \"Lumy\" doesn't need an internet connection.\n\nFeatures:\n- Beautiful Widgets - Quick info about Sun's Current Position\n- Current location & Any place around the world using maps\n- Dynamic Interactive Notifications with the live countdown to the notified time.\n- No Internet Connection needed for golden hour calculation\n- Support for Apple TV\n- Spotlight Search\n- Independent Apple Watch App\n- Beautiful Apple Watch Complications\n- Support for iOS 14, watchOS 7\n\nThe idea is to create an ultimate companion app for photographers.

    "description": "Advanced Brainwave Entrainment combined with Ambient Music, Nature Sounds, Other Audio Apps or your own iTunes Music * Includes Binaural Programs for Sleep, Focus, Memory, Energy, Positive Mood, Motivation, Confidence, Anxiety Relief, Stress Relief, Relaxation, Meditation and much more! * Headphones or Earbuds must be worn for Binaural Tones to be effective * Use the Included Playlist Creator to create an iTunes Playlist for each Program * Can also run alongside other audio apps like Spotify or Audio Book Readers when Background Mode is set to 'Other App' or 'Ambience + Other App'.\n\n* Universal iOS app with UIs included for iPad, iPhone, and iPod Touch, so you can use it on all your supported devices! * Also Supports Family Share * \n\nDifferent states of mind are associated with specific brainwave frequencies that would be inaudible if played directly. These frequencies can be induced in the brain indirectly by playing two different audible tones into each ear, which after being processed by the brain, are perceived as an inaudible beat matching the target brainwave frequency. As you listen, your own brainwaves fall into step with this inaudible beat, and after a few minutes synchronize with the target brainwave frequency. Brain Wave's 35 programs layer these binaural sequences into multi-stage sessions to help users focus and concentrate, feel positive and motivated, and sleep more soundly.\n\n- To use Brain Wave with Spotify or an Audio Book Reader start the other app first and then ours. To listen with a podcast, start Brain Wave first.\n\n- Program duration is fully adjustable. If the program has multiple Binaural Stages the individual stages will be lengthened or shortened accordingly. \n\n- Programs use composite Binaural Tones that stimulate multiple brainwave frequencies to create combination experiences, such as Problem Solving, Power Nap, Pre-Exercise Energy, Dreamy Sleep, and Positive Mood Boost.\n\n- Each program goes through a progression of binaural beats, each for a specific period of time sufficient to synchronize your brainwaves with the binaural tones. \n\n*** Features ***\n\n- 35 Advanced Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Programs to use throughout the day.\n\n- Multiple program durations (10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours). You can also set your own custom duration.\n\n- Use the included Ambience or create a playlist of your own iTunes Music to use with each program. Your brain will process the binaural frequencies played over these background sounds. Binaural Tones are more effective with background audio than alone.\n\n- Save preferred settings, including background audio, iTunes playlist, Alarm settings, and volume for each Brainwave Program.\n\n- Choose from one of the 10 gentle alarm sounds, or select your own iTunes Music track.\n\n** 35 Included Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Programs **\n\n- Morning Coffee\n- Espresso Shot\n- Morning Meditation\n- Focused and Alert\n- Critical Thinking\n- Concentration\n- Memory Boost\n- Problem Solving\n- Brainstorm\n- Confidence Boost\n- Pre-Exercise Energy\n- Creativity Boost\n- Positive Mood Boost\n- Motivation Boost\n- Euphoria\n- Stress Reduction\n- Anger Relief\n- Calm Reflection\n- Reduce Anxiety\n- Deep Relaxation\n- Meditation\n- Lucid Dreaming\n- Dreamy Sleep\n- Power Nap\n- Deep Sleep\n- Deep Sleep with Wake-up Stage\n- Dreamy Sleep with Wake-up Stage\n- Headache Relief\n- Hangover Relief\n- Yoga Meditation\n- Alpha Relaxation\n- Theta Meditation\n- Gamma Power Nap\n- Night Meditation\n- Night Reading\n\n** Included Backgrounds **\n\n- Beach Surf\n- Ocean Waves \n- Ocean Waves 2\n- Rain and Thunder\n- Atmospheres: Serenity\n- Atmospheres: Awakening\n- Atmospheres: Space\n- Atmospheres: Drifting\n- Atmospheres: Peace\n- Atmospheres: Floating\n- Atmospheres: Soaring\n- Medium Rain\n- Light Rain \n- Waterfall \n- Flowing Creek \n- Pink Noise\n- Forest\n\n* Binaural Brainwave entrainment should not be used while driving or operating machinery.",

    "description": "Visualize the fretboard, master scales and play through changes like a pro with intervallic functions! \n\n\n‣ Solo is a revolutionary practice tool designed by world renowned fusion guitarists Tom Quayle and David Beebee.\n\n‣ One of the biggest barriers to improvising on guitar is finding and mapping out the relevant chord tones and scales all over on the fretboard in real time.\n\n\nSolo is a highly focussed app for developing your note finding and visualization ability on the guitar. There is no time-based pressure and Solo reduces the cognitive load of having to choose which ‘notes/intervals’ to play. As you get quicker at finding these ‘notes’ you will conversely get better at choosing them whilst improvising. Players of all ability levels will reap huge benefits from practicing with Solo.\n\n\n‣ Using common progressions, Solo presents you with one chord symbol or scale at a time and asks you to find and play a series of notes based on their intervallic function.\n\n‣ Solo listens to the notes you play, analyzes them in real time, and doesn’t move on until you’ve correctly found each note by its intervallic function in the specified order.\n\n‣ This process builds strong fretboard visualization for the most powerful, efficient and malleable way to KNOW your way around the fretboard no matter how difficult the chord changes are. \n\n\nAs a unique and powerful ear training tool, Solo also develops your ability to not only visualize what you’re playing, but hear it in real time too.\n\nIf you know your note names but struggle to learn new scales, play through chord changes or find yourself stuck in pattern based playing, practicing diligently with Solo will be transformational for your knowledge of the fretboard and subsequently your ability to outline harmony when you improvise. \n\n\n‣ CHANGES PLAYING TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions over a series of chord changes based on common and popular chord progressions. Solo is programmed with all the knowledge behind the scenes to understand jazz and popular music harmony and will always pick appropriate intervallic functions based on the harmony of the progression. \n \n‣ SCALE TRAINER\nPractice finding intervallic functions within scales on the fretboard. Solo includes all the modes of the Major, Melodic Minor, Harmonic Minor and Harmonic Major scales, plus pentatonic and symmetrical scales. Seeing and finding scale tones as intervallic functions will transform your ability to manipulate and improvise with scales in real time.    \n\n‣ TUTORIALS\nSolo also includes video tutorials to get you started with intervallic functions, how to find them on the fretboard, using Solo for ear training and how to get the most from your practice time with the app.\n\n\nNo registration or account required.",

It will turn your phone into a Geiger Müller Counter to measure radioactivity after proper calibration. \n\n** Attention after upgrading iOS to a higher iOS do the calibrate again, as camera data properties might have changed ** \n\n\nDisclaimer: The type of radiation picked up by the camera can be dangerous/detrimental to the user's health as well as cause damage to the device. \n\nImportant note: The camera sensor can measure gamma radiation (CS137 for example) and some beta radiation (depends on the energy if the beta rays can pass through the plastic parts - for example H3 or K14 are weak sources). It cannot measure alpha rays (PO210) For AM241 though its primary a Alpha source also some gamma radiation is emitted and might be detectable for a longer measurement. Please check our homepages for examples and hints on how to measure.\nWe did calibrations with several iPod2*, IPhone 3GS*, iPhone 4*, iPhone 4S, iPhone5, iPhone 5S iPhone 6, 6s and iPad 2, iPad 3* devices at the Helmholtz Research Centre, Munich. we used a CS137 test source from 10 µGy/h till 1 Sv/h for each of the phones we had. The values are stored for a rough start on the application (all devices differ a little bit). For precise professional measurement the devices must be adjusted to the sensor which is possible with the expert setup. For personal use the defaults should be sufficient (please give us feedback). \n* = Attention some phone might not be compatible due the new version of iOS or missing features (gps precision using sim cards)- please try to use an older rev of the App which should be available according to my settings (1.3).",

ObWheel is useful for expectant parents as well as obstetricians, family physicians, nurses, midwives, and students. It uses the date of Last Menstrual Period (LMP) to calculate Estimated Due Date (EDD) and Gestational Age (GA). No more imprecise paper wheels - this tool is always at hand, in your pocket!\n\nWe've separated the outer and inner wheels to make this easy-to-use. Spin the green wheel to set the LMP date. Spin the purple wheel to browse important milestones, and to calculate the gestational age on a specific date (displayed in the middle).\n\nPrefer to enter dates manually? No problem. Select \"Set\" and choose dates by LMP, EDD, or GA on a specific date. Use the \"Info\" screen to see important dates (trimesters, testing and windows) and information on fetal biometry reference ranges (Lessoway) based on current gestational age.\n\nNeed to calculate the EDD from a dating ultrasound report? Rotate the purple wheel until the GA shown matches the GA on the ultrasound report. Then, rotate the green wheel until the date matches the date of the ultrasound. The EDD will be displayed below. Alternatively, input the GA and ultrasound date manually in the \"Set\" screen.\n\nObWheel is a universal app and works on the iPhone and iPad! We are continually working to improve ObWheel, and appreciate your feedback.",

Think of this app as your talk facilitator, taking the pressure and planning out of starting and maintaining dialogue while you monitor how your clients use their speech strategies.\n\n\"This is the app that is going to pave the way for converting speech therapists to the digital age.\"\n- Ryan Knoblauch, SLP, The Speech Knob\n\nGETTING STARTED IS AS EASY AS 1, 2, 3\n\nTarget higher-level expressive language, pragmatic, problem-solving, speech, and cognitive-communication goals with open-ended conversation starters. Here’s how it works.\n\n1) CHOOSE YOUR CATEGORIES. Tailor your experience with specific topics like Food or Health, or select all topics for free-flowing discussion that could go anywhere! You can always change the settings to see only age-appropriate categories for older children, teens, or adults.\n\n2) START THE CONVERSATION. Look at the picture, then touch any of the 10 buttons to see a question. The questions on the left are simpler (like “What is…?”) while the ones on the right are more complex (“How do you know…?”).

    "description": "With Beatly Pro you can generate unlimited amount of 100% original looped music in rap/trap/lo-fi genre.\n\nPro version features:\n\n- exporting to MIDI\n- recording WAV audio file\n- mixer with volume, solo and mute functions\n- instrument track reloading\n- custom samples importing in WAV/M4A format\n- sharing the beat with other Beatly Pro app\n- importing beats from the free version of Beatly\n\nWho is Beatly Pro for:\n\n• composers/producers seeking for quick inspiration or a fresh material to work with\n• artists/singers in need of unique rap/rnb beats on demand, e.g. for flow practicing\n• developers, film-makers, digital content creators, who need to use free and original music in any kind of multimedia\n• pretty much anyone interested in generative art and nonmainstream music\n\nHow it works:\n\nBeatly Pro randomly chooses set of instruments and creates 2 unique bars of looped instrumental music (8 beats). Tempo is chosen automatically, however it can be simply changed. All notes are picked by the algorithm, so the beat style may range from soft piano rnb to aggressive trap. Each beat can be easily saved and loaded later again. \n\nRun app, tap the play button. It is that simple. Music will be different each time you hit the reload button. Once you find the right tune for you, simply save it for later, export to MIDI or record your live session to WAV audio file.\n\nDrums too loud? Adjust the volume. Synth annoying? Mute it. Loving the sound of piano? Solo it. Mixer got your back! Need variation? Reload any instrument within your beat.\n\nCan I import my own samples?\n\nYes! You can attach your very own WAV or M4A sound to any instrument track (except drums and orchestral track). Just bear in mind, samples tuned in C will sound best! :)\n\nHow do I import my beats from free Beatly?\n\nIn free Beatly app, navigate to menu, tap Share beat, select Beatly Pro, open Beatly Pro - you're done, beat has been imported! :)\n\nIf you like Beatly Pro, please, support us by rating this app in the App Store! If you have any idea how to improve Beatly Pro, please, leave us a message! Thank you!",

    "description": "Today’s live productions require more than simply showing a speaker or a powerpoint. Often you are asked to include live cameras, a powerpoint presentation, a moderator and Zoom participants on the hybrid or virtual event.\nA multi Picture in Picture (PIP) composition is state of the art to show different contents on the same time.\nWith an ATEM 2/4 M/E or with an ATEM Constellation you can create up to 4 PIPs with the integrated SuperSource.\nWith TouchDirector App you can control, save, share or download SuperSource compositions.\nYou can save SuperSource setups into your iCloud and download it on another device or share them.\nAnd you can use the preinstalled SuperSource compositions.\nVideo sources can be switched directly in the selected SuperSource Box with TouchDirector “SSRC” tab while SuperSouce is on air.\nIt is necessary to switch the video sources for the PIPs very fast. I.e. when a Zoom or conference participant begins to speak, you have maximum of half a second to switch him to air into one of the 2, 3 or 4 PIP boxes. The multi PIP workflow with TouchDirector is very fast: to select the box and switch to the correct video source takes about 0.3 sec.\nBecause of the lack of SuperSource in non 2/4 M/E ATEM switchers, we developed a “virtual Multi PIP solution” with “TouchDirector PiP” app. Many of those users own a second ATEM switcher, e.g. an ATEM Mini. Using the second switcher with this app you can create a Multi PIP screen. You can control the first ATEM Mini with TouchDirector PiP app, working on any iPhone (6s and newer) or iPad, and control the bigger ATEM or the second Mini with TouchDirector app or with a second TouchDirector PiP app.\nThe virtual multi PIP uses the DVE key 1, available on every ATEM switcher.\nTouchDirector PiP app distinguishes between 2/4 M/E ATEM switchers and 1 M/E ATEM like ATEM Mini and TV-Studio and switches automatically to use SSRC or DVEK version.\nIn addition to the SSRC compositions we preinstalled some DVEK compositions, which can also be saved, shared or downloaded.\nWe derived TouchDirector PiP from TouchDirector full version. Experience has shown that it is better to control the SuperSource or DVE Key using a separate device.",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

Please check the Apple Support page to learn how to FORCE CLOSE an app: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201330\n\n* Black screen issues: Some third party apps prevent screen mirroring. When you try to mirror them, you will just see a black screen on your TV, for example with Netflix and Disney+. This is a restriction chosen by Netflix and others, so we cannot fix it at the moment.\n\n\nIf you like the app and our constant work on it, please give the app a positive rating on the App Store.

    "description": "A real life crime story where you play detective.\n\n** Winner of 3 Bafta Awards, 2 IGF Awards, 3 GDC Awards, Best Narrative & Best Performance at The Game Awards 2015, The Grand Jury Award at IndieCade, Polygon's Game of the Year, SXSW Mobile Game of the Year, Webby Award for Best Mobile Game, 5 IMGA Awards and more! **\n\n\"Her Story is one of the most entrancing experiences you can hope to find on mobile\"\n9/10, Pocket Gamer\n\n\"It’s a murder case where you’re in the detective’s chair, a mystery where you make the running, and an engrossing experience from start to finish. With this we should consign the term “interactive movie” to history’s dustbin, because movies can’t dream of offering audiences a narrative structure as intimate and involving as this: they’re just moving pictures. Her Story points to the future\" 5/5, The Guardian\n\nHer Story is the critically acclaimed mystery game from Sam Barlow. Playing like an interactive true crime documentary, the game lets you go hands on with a police database full of live action video footage. It stars Viva Seifert, actress and one half of the band Joe Gideon and the Shark.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nHer Story sits you in front of a mothballed desktop computer and logs you into a police database. Search through hundreds of video clips that cover seven interviews from 1994 in which a British woman is interviewed about her missing husband. Explore the database by typing search terms, watch the clips where she speaks those words and piece together her story.\n\n\"Her Story is a beautiful amalgam of the cinema and video game formats... a remarkable achievement...\" 90, The Washington Post\n\n\"Profound, gripping live-action drama… sure to be discussed for years to come\" 5/5, Digital Spy\n\nUnlike anything you've played before, Her Story is an involving and moving experience. One that asks you to listen.",
