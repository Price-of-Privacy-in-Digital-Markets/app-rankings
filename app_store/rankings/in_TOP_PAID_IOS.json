No subscriptions. \n\nAbout AutoSleep\n-----------------\nUsing Advanced Heuristics AutoSleep works out how long you've slept so you don't have to.\n\nIf you DO wear your Watch to bed, you don't need to do a single thing. AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning.\n\nEven if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.\n\nIf you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher. WatchOS 5 recommended.\n\nBest of 2018\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1438574124?ign-itscg=as10001&ign-itsct=BESTOF_SC18_PT122_US_SI1438574124\n\nBest of 2019\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1484100916?ign-itsct=BestOfApps_SC09_PT006_WW%2F&ign-itscg=10000\n\nBest of 2020\nhttps://apps.apple.com/story/id1535572713/",

    "description": "DoubleTake by FiLMiC transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 13 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and 2020.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 13, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nDoubleTake gives you an early look at the multi-cam capability that will be coming to our award-winning cinema camera app FiLMiC Pro.  \n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll.",

    "description": "GeoShred Pro Version 5, is an exciting update, now with In-App-Purchases for GeoSWAM instruments on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater.  \n\nImagine a new kind of musical instrument ... \n\nAn instrument where a performer can fluidly express multiple independent voices.  An instrument that is both pitch fluid, and helps the performer precisely reach desired musical pitches in any temperament.  \n\nGeoShred is an award-winning,  fluidly expressive musical instrument that runs on multi-touch devices. \n\nIt has a performance surface with “almost magic” pitch rounding algorithms which is coupled with a model of the physics of several types of musical instruments, support for AUv3, MIDI In/Out, MPE, and 3D Touch.  It’s a fusion of Jordan Rudess’ performance concepts and a powerful, modeled guitar/effects based on the Physical Modeling research of Dr. Julius O. Smith III of Stanford/CCRMA.  And, GeoShred's expressive control can be used with other synthesizers.\n\nTens of thousands of artists in 48 countries perform GeoShred with 30% of those users in India. \n\nGeoShred is the Gold Medal Winner of the 2019 Denny Award, winner of a 2019 Guthman New Musical Instrument Award, and winner of the 2017 Electronic Musician Editor's Choice Award as \"one of the most innovative, groundbreaking products to emerge in the past twelve months\".\n\n\nGeoShred Pro Version 5 Features include:\n\n• In-App-Purchases (IAP) for 6 different GeoSWAM instruments, GeoViolin, GeoFlute, GeoTenoSax, GeoCello, GeoClarinet, and GeoOboe \n• A fluidly expressive playing surface + a Physically modeled guitar\n• Au3 plugin support on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater \n• Intelligent pitch rounding\n• A diatonic keyboard where every key on the screen is in the scale.\n• MIDI IN/OUT and MPE support\n• MIDI control using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, virtual MIDI and all digital interfaces \n• MIDI configuration presets\n• 3D touch on iPhones that support 3D touch\n• Customizable control surface can be mapped to physical MIDI controls\n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus support.\n• Backing tracks\n• Multiple Modeled effects\n• Modeled feedback and VCF effects\n• Echo, a unique looper and multi-tap echo \n• Finger vibrato, slide and fret scraping\n• Unique mono mode using intervals of multiple strings. \n• Built-in Arpeggiator\n• Alternative tunings and temperaments\n• Support for world scales and temperaments including Indian Ragas, Arabic and Balinese scales. \n• Easily share presets with friends\n\n---\n \nPraise for the GeoShred family of apps: \n\n“GeoShred is brilliant- it’s a real instrument.” – Eddie Jobson\n\n“A fantastic new invention which is going to revolutionize the way music is played, expressed and learned! “GeoShred” is one of the foremost best musical inventions I’ve had the pleasure to experience in recent years. Definitely 5 stars out of 5! GIGANTASTIVISSIMO…..R…A…Z !!!!!” – Patrick Moraz\n\n“That’s just nuts. You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.  It would mean a lot to us if you could leave your positive review on the App Store and If you have any questions about GeoShred we would love to hear from you at our support email address: support@moforte.com \n\n---\n\nMinimum Requirements:  iOS 11.4 or better is required for AUv3, iCloud and GeoSWAM instruments.\n***Note: The GeoSWAM instruments can ONLY be performed from the GeoShred keyboard or MPE controllers.\n***Note: Unfortunately, due to App Store limitations, previously purchased instrument IAPs can not be applied to a purchase of the collection IAP.",

Universal Breathing - Pranayama was created by doctors, designers and app developers to provide the perfect breathing experience.

In detailed mode, the text being encoded is scrolling through the decoding process. \n\nTap some morse code onto the screen and the program will translate it into some text. \nDifferent input types are handled : Novice, Straight key, Memory Paddle, Iambic Paddle (A and B), Microphone. Left and right handed modes supported. \nTest and improve your skills : are you good enough to be understood? \n\nCreate audio files containing Morse code in a dynamic way or from a given text.\nUse those files as you wish : listen to them to train your decoding skills or use them as ringtones for your phone.\n\nExclusive feature allowing to decode, in real time, the Morse code recorded from the microphone into Text (the sound must be quite clear/loud and without much noise). \nSome automatic calibration is performed, allowing adaptation to speed, tone and volume changes. \n\nThe full Morse alphabet can also be consulted and the associated Morse code can be played. \nTapped and decoded text can be edited and exported to the clipboard, the In-app email and SMS. \nA special screen allows textual conversion of morse code and text. Exchange encoded messages with your friends. \n\nWikipedia and Visual Mnemonic screens allowing to get informations and mnemonics regarding morse code.\nYou can also add your own web sites for an in-app consultation.\nAll the application is highly configurable (Frequency, WPM, tone type, color, morse characters, variables ...) \n\n!!! As seen on TV !!! (UK) in Most Haunted Live: Apparently you can use it to communicate with ghosts (no guaranty though) \n\nPremium features can also be unlocked as a single in-app purchase : \nKoch trainer screen, CWops Academy learning method, Quiz screen, Prosigns, Macros, Dictionaries : abbreviations, QSOs, mnemonics, Timing (farnsworth) and Morse alphabet/prosigns personalization, look customization ... and more.\n\nMorse-it is powered by Icom, a world leader in the amateur radio market.",

The updated management guidelines aim to:\n • Allow for a more complete and precise estimation of risk\n • Provide more appropriate intervention for high-risk individuals (detect and treat more precancer)\n • Recommend less intervention for low-risk individuals (decrease testing and treatment that won’t prevent cancer and may cause reproductive harm)\n • Allow for the future addition of new risk modifiers and screening and management technologies\n\nSee https://www.asccp.org/UserGuide for tips on using the app.",
