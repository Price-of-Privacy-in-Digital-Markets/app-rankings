    "description": "We are @moment and Pro Camera is the app we’ve always wanted. Manual controls, better video, long exposure and quick access to the settings we need. It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.\n\nFor Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR. Shoot in RAW (even in BURST), split focus / exposure, and manually control everything (exposure, iso, shutter speed, white balance and focus).\n\nFor Everyone Else - inspired by the pro’s we made the interface simple, fast, and easy to use. We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you. If you have any features, ideas, or feedback please email us at hello@shopmoment.com or DM us on Instagram @moment.\n\n## Premium Features\n+ NEW Timelapse mode - capture stunning time-lapse videos.\n+ Slow Shutter mode - long exposure shots with motion blur and light trails.\n\n## Photography Features\n+ Focus peaking - the green edges will help you dial in your focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ RAW and TIFF - Shoot photos in RAW format for better editing, or TIFF for high-quality printing.\n+ Split Focus and Exposure - Take control of tricky lighting scenarios.\n+ Full Manual - Control shutter speed, iso, exposure, focus, and white balance with easy to use sliders and double taps to reset.\n+ Burst mode - Capture burst shots in RAW format. This is big as now you can capture action with burst but at the uncompressed quality pros want with RAW.\n+ HEIF and HEVC - Seamless support for the latest Apple file formats across photos and videos.\n\n## Filmmaker Features\n+ Focus peaking - the yellow edge glow will help you find dial in the focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ Color Profiles - Select from default, flat, or log color profiles to get the most out of your files in post-processing.\n+ Video Bitrates - Get precise control over video quality with standard, medium, and high bitrates to choose from.\n+ RGB Histogram: Dial in your video color, balance, and exposure with a live RGB histogram.\n+ Waveform monitor - Evaluate video brightness and exposure across your image in real time.\n+ Audio meters - Get just the right sound levels with real-time, precise, dual-channel (when available) audio levels.\n+ Live Histogram - Get your exposure right every time.\n+ Video Stabilization - Make your videos buttery smooth.\n+ Precise Video - Change your resolution and frame rate on screen, without digging into a settings menu.\n+ Anamorphic - Use the Moment Anamorphic lens to shoot amazing, letterbox style photos and videos.\n\n## Works With\n+ Triple/Dual Lens Control - Manually control which side of the triple/dual lens you want to shoot with so you can use Moment lenses over either one.\n+ Moment Lens - select which lens you are shooting with.\n+ Moment Battery Case - Works with the DSLR-like shutter button on our photography cases for half-press and full-press capture. Take better photos, faster.\n+ Apple Watch - Use your watch as a remote to shoot photos or record videos.\n+ Siri Shortcuts - Quick access to capture a photo or start a video\n\nRAW and 3D shutter require an iPhone 6S or later (6S, 7, 8, X, XS, XR, SE)",

AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note.

    "description": "DoubleTake by FiLMiC transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 13 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and 2020.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 13, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nDoubleTake gives you an early look at the multi-cam capability that will be coming to our award-winning cinema camera app FiLMiC Pro.  \n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll.",

    "description": "Noir is a Safari extension that automatically adds a dark mode to every website you visit.\n\nIt makes browsing the web at night so much better. With Noir, you won’t be blinded by bright websites ever again.\n\nAnd the results look great too. Noir generates a custom dark style for each website you visit, based on the colors that are used on a page. You won’t even notice this happening in the background – that’s how fast it it – but you’ll certainly appreciate the end result: a beautiful dark mode tailored for each website, where contrast is preserved and highlights still pop.\n\nNoir works with any website you visit in Safari, automatically. By default, Noir is linked to your device’s Dark Mode, so websites will only go dark when you want them to. But you can easily customize this to your liking, even per website. Only want to use Noir on just a few specific websites? Sure thing! Disable Noir on some websites? No problem!\n\nBuilt from the ground up for iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, the app feels right at home on your device. It supports the brand new Safari web extension feature, which means there’s no need to manually activate it every time you load a new page. The app also tightly integrates with system features such as Shortcuts to fully integrate Noir in all your workflows.\n\nAnd just as importantly, Noir takes your privacy seriously: it doesn’t collect any of your browsing data. Period.\n\nNoir is made by a solo iOS developer. It does not include any subscriptions or ads. Buy Noir once, use it forever.\n\nNotes:\n• Found a website where Noir’s dark mode doesn’t look just right? Let me know by reporting it. The app will be frequently updated to address issues that are reported.\n\nPrivacy Policy:\n• The Noir extension requires access to the websites you visit to analyze the existing style of the page and to override it with Noir's dark style.\n• Noir never collects your browsing data. The only data Noir ‘collects’ are your settings, and those will never leave your device.\n• You can read Noir’s full Privacy Policy at https://getnoir.app/privacypolicy",

On Mac, Fliqlo has long been popular as a screensaver module with the same design since its first release in 2002, and this iOS/iPadOS app is also made with the same design. With its large, highly visible font, you can check the time even from a distance. Also, in everyday life and at work, its modest presence does not distract you or disrupt your productivity, even when using the app for extended periods of time. Its appearance integrates with the device body and blends into your living space ambience, as if it were a minimalist home decor item.\n\nFEATURES:\n- Switch between 12/24 hour clock\n- Switch between portrait and landscape mode\n- Brightness/dimness control inside the app\n- Show/hide background tiles\n- Enlarge/reduce to any size\n\nNOTES:\n- Your device’s Auto-Lock is disabled while this clock is active in the foreground.\n- This app does not start automatically like the Mac screensaver.\n- You cannot replace your device’s Lock Screen with this clock.",

The app supports 2 accurately tuned/synthesised, tanpuras each with 6 strings and other advanced controls, all on a single page.\n\nI am a signal processing engineer by profession and Hindustani classical singer by passion. I have developed this app after rigorous analysis of the resonance of instrument. Connect your device to good speakers and enjoy the sound in high fidelity. Ideally place the speakers at least 3 to 4 feet away for the best effect.\n\nThis version contains several digitized tanpura profiles. Use them and adjust the tempo/pluck-style to get the best combination that suits your taste. Two full octaves are now supported. Use the higher pitches with caution as they may sound  little shrill and are suitable for use only with instruments.\n\n * About Bheema Tanpura  *\n\n\"This application takes its name from one of the greatest hindustani classical singers of our times, Pt Bhimsen Joshi, the maestro of Kiraana School of North-Indian classical music.

    "description": "TV Remote allows you to take control of your television from your mobile device.\n\n* As featured on 9to5Mac, iPhon.fr & MacMagazine *\n\nTV Remote features a beautifully simple design that makes it easy to start controlling your television set. It's deliberately simple and feels familiar no matter the television you are using the remote app with.\n\nThe app is compatible with the following television brands:\n\n- LG (webOS, 2016+)\n- Samsung (Tizen, 2017+ / M+)\n- Sony (Android TV)\n- Roku (Roku)\n- Sky Q\n- TCL (Roku)\n- Hitachi (Roku, Vestel)\n- Sharp (Roku, Vestel)\n- Hisense (Roku)\n- Philips (Roku)\n- Toshiba (Vestel)\n- JVC (Roku, Vestel)\n- Bush (Vestel)\n- Celcus (Vestel)\n- Digihome (Vestel)\n- Element (Roku)\n- Finlux (Vestel)\n- Gogen (Vestel)\n- Hyundai (Vestel)\n- Kendo (Vestel)\n- Kunft (Vestel)\n- Laurus (Vestel)\n- Linsar (Vestel)\n- Luxor (Vestel)\n- Magnavox (Roku)\n- Mitsai (Vestel)\n- Nabo (Vestel)\n- Orava (Vestel)\n- Polaroid (Vestel)\n- Qilive (Vestel)\n- Salora (Vestel)\n- Sanyo (Roku)\n- Techwood (Vestel)\n- Telefunken (Vestel)\n- Turbo-X (Vestel)\n- Vestel (Vestel)\n- Vox (Vestel)\n- Walker (Vestel)\n- Westinghouse (Roku)\n- X-Vision (Vestel)\n\nTV Remote contains these great features:\n\nTV REMOTE\n\nAfter adding your TV, you’re ready to go! TV Remote contains the majority of keys you’d find on the standard remote control in a clear, simple and easy to use interface. All controls that don’t fit on the screen have been added to a special menu - accessed by tapping the ellipsis icon. When tapping a key, you’ll receive haptic feedback so you know you’ve pressed it.\n\n\nAPPLE WATCH APP\n\nIf you have an Apple Watch, you can take advantage of the TV Remote app for watchOS. Televisions sync via iCloud so you won’t need to re-add them on your Apple Watch. Once synced, you’ll then be able to control power, volume and channel straight from your wrist!\n\n\nWIDGETS\n\nAdd one of the four widgets to your device's Home Screen to take advantage of quick actions. You can choose from a single custom command, multiple custom commands, switching television channels or switching connected televisions.\n\n\nSIRI SHORTCUTS\n\nControl your television using Siri. Setup TV Remote with the Siri Shortcuts app and you'll be able to start controlling your television with just your voice or add them as part of an automated workflow. You can switch channels, send commands, open apps or even change sources!\n\n\nKEYBOARD ENTRY\n\nUse the in-app keyboard to type out text that will appear on your TV in supported text fields.\n\n\nAPPS\n\nLaunch apps on your TV directly from the TV Remote app.\n\n\nPOWER ON\n\nBy using WOL (Wake-on-LAN), TV Remote can power on your TV even when it is off! Just enter your MAC address in the Settings screen to use it.\n\n\nTHEMES\n\nChoose exactly how you want your remote to look!\n\n\nTOUCHPAD\n\nControl your TV using a touchpad for easier navigation.\n\n\nTV SEARCH\n\nAdding compatible televisions couldn’t be simpler! Ensure your television is switched on and then tap the Add Television button. TV Remote will then do the rest by detecting any compatible televisions connected to the same WiFi network.\n\n\nMULTIPLE TELEVISIONS\n\nIf you have more than one supported television, you can add them all to the TV Remote app quickly and simply from the television switcher menu.\n\n\nSYNCING\n\nAll your televisions automatically sync using your iCloud account! Add on your iPhone and televisions will automatically appear on your iPad.\n\n\nACCESSIBILITY\n\nThe app has been developed throughout to support VoiceOver & Dynamic Type users.\n\n\nGet in contact:\n\nEmail: info@adamfoot.dev\nTwitter: @adamfootdev\nWebsite: https://adamfoot.dev\n\nPlease note, a supported television is required for full app functionality. TV Remote may not support all televisions provided by the manufacturers listed above.\n\nAll brand names, copyrights and trademarks belong to the companies and not the TV Remote app.",
