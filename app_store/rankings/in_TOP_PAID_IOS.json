We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you.

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

    "description": "“The biggest software advance for writers since the word processor.” —Michael Marshall Smith, bestselling author\n\nTypewriter. Ring-binder. Scrapbook. Scrivener combines all the writing tools you need to craft your first draft, from nascent notion to final full stop.\n\nTailor-made for creating long manuscripts, Scrivener banishes page fright by allowing you to compose your text in any order, in sections as large or small as you like. Got a great idea but don’t know where it fits? Write when inspiration strikes and find its place later. Grow your manuscript organically, idea by idea.\n\nWhether you plan or plunge, Scrivener works your way: meticulously outline every last detail first, or hammer out a complete draft and restructure later. Or do a bit of both. All text sections in Scrivener are fully integrated with its outlining tools, so working with an overview of your manuscript is only ever a tap away, and turning Chapter Four into Chapter One is as simple as drag and drop.\n\nNeed to refer to research? In Scrivener, your background material is always at hand. Write a description based on a photograph. Reference a video or PDF. Check for consistency with an earlier chapter. On the iPad, open two documents side-by-side; on the iPhone, flip between research and writing with just two taps.\n\nOnce you’re ready to share your work with the world, simply compile everything into a single document for printing, or export to popular formats such as Word, PDF, Final Draft or plain text. You can even share using different formatting, so that you can write in your favorite font and still keep your editor happy.\n\n\nFEATURES\n\nGet Started\n• Interactive tutorial project\n• Keep each manuscript and supporting materials in a self-contained project\n• Import Word, RTF, Final Draft and plain text files\n• Easily split imported text into separate sections\n\nGet Writing\n• Write your manuscript in sections of any size\n• View all sections as a single text using the “Draft Navigator” (iPad only)\n• Quickly navigate sections using the “binder” sidebar\n• Format with fonts and presets\n• Comments, footnotes, links and highlights\n• Simple bullets and lists\n• Insert images\n• Pinch-zoom to resize text\n• Full-screen mode (iPad only)\n• Typewriter scrolling mode keeps typed text center-screen (iPad only)\n• Write a screenplay using scriptwriting mode\n• Live word and character counts\n• Set word and character count targets\n• Find and replace\n• Customizable keyboard row provides quick-access buttons for formatting, navigation and punctuation\n• Comprehensive keyboard shortcuts for external keyboard users\n• Dark mode\n\nFind Your Structure\n• Write in any order and reorganize later\n• Write a synopsis for any text section and see it in the outline\n• Expand, collapse and drill down into sections of your project\n• Rearrange sections as index cards on the corkboard (iPad only)\n• Project-wide search\n• Track ideas using labels and status\n• Apply custom icons to your sections\n\nRefer to Research\n• Import research material such as image, PDF and media files\n• View research files or other sections right alongside your writing (iPad only)\n• Every section has its own notes area for jotting down ideas\n• Supports multi-tasking split screen mode (supported devices only)\n\nShare Your Work\n• Compile to a single document for sharing or printing\n• Use different formatting in your exported or printed document\n• Export to Word, RTF, Final Draft, PDF or plain text\n• Convert rich text to Markdown for sharing with Markdown apps\n• Create and email zipped backups of your projects\n\nWork Anywhere\n• Use Dropbox to sync between devices and with the macOS and Windows versions of Scrivener*\n• Copy projects between devices via iTunes\n\n* Requires a Dropbox account (not compatible with iCloud).\n\nSUPPORT\nYou can contact us at ios.support@literatureandlatte.com, visit our forums at http://www.literatureandlatte.com/forum, or find us @scrivenerapp on Twitter.",

    "description": "\"Editor´s Choice Award\" by Children´s Technology Review for Excellence in Design! \n\nwired.com: \"It’s not quite a storybook, and not quite a video game. It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\n“CHOMP by Christoph Niemann” is the latest imagination from internationally renowned children’s author and illustrator Christoph Niemann, whose App ‘Petting Zoo’ is already loved by millions of children and families around the world.\n\n‘CHOMP’ combines playful, humorous, and lovingly hand-drawn animations with live video, enabling children and adults alike to slip into a variety of comical roles. From a virtuous pianist, to a spaghetti-slurping dog, or a living cuckoo-clock, anything is possible!\n\nWhat makes this App so inspiring and special is that children participate using their own faces, mimicry, and song, allowing their creativity to run free.\n\nWith the video functions, all of these adventures can be saved forever. ‘CHOMP’ is so easy and intuitive to use that kids can create and sing their own personal messages to send to parents, grandparents, friends, or siblings, all in the blink of an eye.\n\nHighlights :\n\n•\tHand drawn animations made with love and care.\n•\tOver 50 hand-drawn scenes with countless funny animations.\n•\tFun for all ages.\n•\tNo language knowledge needed. The app is text-free.\n•\tNo in-app purchases, invasive advertising, or data mining.\n•\tRecord play sessions with integrated video recording.\n\nINSTRUCTIONS: \n•\tChildren can swipe left and right to change animations. Tap the screen to see the fun.\n•\tGrownups can open the camera menu in the bottom left to record videos. Tap to microphone icon to enable sound recording, use the large center button to start and stop video recording.\n•\tPlease enable camera permissions when prompted.\n\nJust as with his App ‘Petting Zoo’ and his New York Times blog ‘Abstract City’, Christoph Niemann uses ‘CHOMP’ to once again show us his own unique, absurd, and always funny view of the world.\n\nPress reviews:\n\nwired.com:\n\"It’s not quite a storybook, and not quite a video game. It’s ostensibly for kids, but its creative appeal is universal. It’s definitely digital, but feels analog. The app lives at the intersection of all these things, which is one reason it’s such fun to play.\"\n\nPlease also check out our other great App for kids:\n\n“PETTING ZOO” - is a fantastic storybook app. It features beautiful, fun, interactive animations of over 20 animals, and it’s bound to be a big favorite for kids and animal lovers of all ages.\n\nAbout Fox & Sheep:\nWe are a Studio in Berlin and develop high quality apps for kids at the age of 2-8 years. We are parents ourselves and work passionately and with a lot of commitment on our products. We work with the best illustrators and animators around the world to create and present the best apps possible – to enrich the lives of our and your kids.",

    "description": "All of us have struggled with storage space limitations on our devices and the unpleasant task of choosing which videos to delete in order to free up some space. If you relate to this, we have exceptionally good news for you! Multi Video Compressor allows you to minimize the size of your videos and get more storage space without any quality loss. You can also send the videos to your friends and family faster, since smaller files take less time to upload!\n\nYou can compress one video or up to 20 videos at a time to make the process even faster. These are some of advantages of using this application:\n\n- Different compression options: reduce the resolution or dimension of the video, for example from 1920x1080 to 960x540 or reduce the bitrate of the video\n- Intuitive and easy to use interface\n- Preserve sound quality\n- Faster uploads and sending via messaging apps\n- Keep both reduced and original files\n- Restore deleted files if needed\n- Multiple file compression\n- Your private files stay secured\n- Offline compression\n- No need to delete your favorite videos to free up space\n\nMost importantly, the sound in the video will remain unchanged so that you can enjoy videos of the highest quality. \nBy using this app, you get to free up storage space and also make your uploads faster. Smaller files take less time to upload to clouds, social media, and messaging applications, which is another surprising advantage of using Multi Video Compressor. If you prefer to keep the original uncompressed files, you are free to do so. If you delete a file by mistake and want to restore it, you can later find it in the “Recently deleted” folder. \nAnother piece of good news is that this application supports a lot of different video formats, so you will not need to use a video converter to compress your files. \n\nMulti Video Compressor supports the following formats:\n- mov\n- mp4\n- m4v\n- sdv\n- 3gp\n- 3gpp\n- 3g2\n- 3gp2\n\nAt this point, there is really no reason not to use this app!

It is important to note that this application operates in the offline mode only, that means that no data is being sent to any server, cloud, or any third-party application. This is our way of making sure that your data stays protected and that only you have access to your private files.\n\nYou do not need to worry about deleting your favorite videos to free up space anymore. Download this app to try out this modern approach to data storage and enjoy all the benefits!\n\nWe’re planning to develop our application together with you.\nFor any questions, contact support - hello@lanars.com",

    "description": "AirMicCam - video camera with bluetooth audio\nCapture clear audio at a distance from the phone or in noisy environments. This camera app records audio from your Bluetooth headset. \n\nLite version (free to test - limit 10 sec recording)\nhttps://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airmiccam-lite-15sec-limit/id1327155759?mt=8\n\n#AirMicCam\n\nEasy automatic features you know from Camera app (touch for exposure & focus)\nPlus Manual Exposure, Shutter Duration, Focus and White Balance.\n\nNote for Audiophiles - Bluetooth headsets are tuned for vocal clarity in wild environments. This app is perfect for communicating - although tonal quality is compressed through aggressive codec and narrow sample rate and frequency response. AirPods and headsets using Bluetooth 4.1 or 4.2 are best.\n\nShoot interviews for blog, Youtube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and social media. Citizen journalism, short or feature documentary and commentary. Archives of lectures to make transcripts, video journals, hands-free DIY Maker tutorials, home and car repair How-Tos, makeup and beauty tips, educational forums, Voice-over narration of tech expo demos and product reviews. Surprise/ambush friends & family (be nice), challenge politicians with questions, movie stars, style, fashion celebrity and podcasts. Be like Paparazzi, TMZ, WorldStar. Capture ratchet antics. Explain tricks, pranks or hacks (legal shortcuts, not electronic intrusion). Follow applicable laws in your country. \n\nThere are more professional cable and radio microphones and digital cameras, but the convenience of depending on what you have in your pocket and around your ear/neck is better than missing the opportunity to capture the moment. Or have alternative/backup/PlanB in your pocket. Journalists, don't miss out (no more FOMO) on a breaking press conference - use the gear on hand.\n\nYou can’t plan when you will be witness to an amazing story. With your phone and headset you can inform the world about a hurricane, earthquake, tsunami; narrate UFC, World Cup, Copa, Liga, football or rugby league game/match; or give teasers, spoilers, wrap ups of latest season of your favorite film or show on HBO, Amazon or Netflix.\n\nReport & file history. Join the media discourse. Report on the instant news (traffic, weather, stocks/economy/markets, energy/petroleum, aerospace/NASA, defense/war/Pentagon) United Kingdom Brexit, President Donald Trump, Bernie Sanders, GOP, nationalists, liberals, Senate, Bitcoin/Ethereum/Cyptocurrency. \n\nEach headset or earbuds is different and can have better or worse connection stability, audio enhancement, bitrate, EQ and compression. Test yours to understand its limitations so you can rely on documenting the time.\n\nPLUS more features are planned that will be free upgrades.\n\nThis is a tool. Use it responsibly.",

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported.

    "description": "The Panchang is ancient spiritual and scientific calendar system based on the positions of the planets, the sun and moon. One year is composed of 12 lunar months of around 29 days and 12 hours.\n\nFor every year, our panchang contains more than 340 important date of events and holy festivals in India. It reflects India's culture through the Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian and civil festivals happening all along the year. Nearly all the festivals are illustrated with a colorful image.\n\nThe calendar covers the full 2021 year. It also contains all the information from year 2009.\n\nIt contains all the details about the lunar cycles (Tithi and Karana), the planets (Nakshatra), the moon/sun combinaisons (Yoga), the full moons or purnima, the new moon or amavasaya, ... along with the Sunrise and Sunset timings.\n\nWhat's included:\n- Sun, Thithi and Nakshatra timings for several cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata) and around the World: Paris, London, Geneva, Moscow,New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, Los Angeles, Cape Town, Toronto, Melbourne, Sydney, Tokoy, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Hawaii, St Denis Réunion, Kuweit City, Colombo, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur. The timings are taking the daylight savings into account.\n Panchak for every month\n- At startup, the current month will be displayed, with an emphasis on the current day. Just clic on any day to get all the details about this particular day.\n- Lunar month days\n- Display the details on a day, including: western calendar information (gregorian calendar), Tithi information (moon day name, Shuklapaksh, Krishnapaksh, timings), Nakshatra (name and timings), Sun timings, list of festivals of that day\n- Display Vikram Samwat and Saka Samwat\n- A list of full moon (purnima) and new moon (amavasaya)\n- A list of events and holy festivals, sorted by months, with direct access to any month.\n- A list of government gazetted holidays\n- A very convenient search tool: Just type a word or the part of a word and get the list of all events related to your search.\n- An image for nearly every event\n- A list of major cities for which you want to see the detailed panchang. If your city is not in the list, you just select the closest one.\n\nWith the search tool, you can:\n- Write \"Prad\", you'll get the full list of Pradosh vrat of the year (worship of Lord Shiva, which is observed on the Trayodashi of both the fortnight - Shukla and Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Eka\", you'll get the full list of Ekadashi of the year (Ekadashi occurs on the 11th day of the bright half - called Shukla Paksha and on the 11th of the dark half called Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Chatur\", you'll get the full list of Ganesha and Vinayak Chaturthi of the year\n- Write \"Rohini\" or \"Ashtami\", and so on...\n\nOur calendar complied a Hindu Panchang according to Vedic science and modern outlook. We did a deep study to give you accurate information. We are still improving our panchang and updating the event's list.\n\nLiability Exclusion: We make every effort to ensure, but do not guarantee, the accuracy of the information on this calendar.

That means that even if you are viewing any website with HTTPS. Anyone listening to packets on the network still can know you are visiting some websites. It is easy for a Man-In-The-Middle to change DNS answers to route unsuspecting visitors to their phishing, malware, or surveillance site with unencrypted DNS. Your ISP, router, the network provider may have the ability to track you. So. here comes DNS over HTTPS or DNS over TLS to secure the DNS query.\n\n# Feature\n\nThis app uses the iOS 14 new feature DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS. The First app has DNS over HTTPS and DNS over TLS without any VPN config.

    "description": "Hey you! Yeah you! Shouldn't you be looking for Camera+ 2 instead? Our newest app has been rebuilt from the ground app to support the next 10 years (or 20, who knows?) of mobile photography. Check it out at http://camera.plus \n\nOver 10 million sold!\n\n“The Clarity filter is iPhone photography’s secret sauce—it adds pro-camera crispness to almost any shot.”\n— Kevin Sintumuang, The Wall Street Journal\n\n“If the iPhone’s standard camera is like a digital point-and-shoot, the Camera+ app is like a high-quality SLR lens.”\n— TIME: 50 Best iPhone Apps 2011\n\n“improves on almost every aspect of the built-in camera app”\n— Charlie Sorrel, Wired\n\nWinner: Best Visual Design, Best Photography App\n— Best App Ever Awards\n\n\nIt’s all about one thing... great photos!\n\nWhether you’re a seasoned photographer or someone who’s barely touched a camera, Camera+ will make you love taking photos.\n\nTouch Exposure & Focus\nSet exposure separately from focus. You can now easily control how light or dark your shots come out.\n\nShooting Modes\nUse the Stabilizer to steady your iPhone and get the sharpest photos you can. There are countless uses for the Timer including taking the highest-quailty self-portraits. Capture all the action by using Burst to take rapid streams of shots.\n\nDigital Zoom\nUp to 6× zoom with advanced digital processing provides you with quality that simply blows away the competition.\n\nFront Flash\nHow many times have you wanted to take a pic of yourself in a dark room but couldn’t. Well, now you can!\n\nHorizon Level\nUse the Horizon Level to eliminate taking crooked shots.\n\nClarity\nClarity is one of the biggest breakthroughs to happen to image processing in a long time. Clarity analyzes your photos and makes several intelligent adjustments that magically bring out details and breathe life into dull photos. With Clarity, you’ll stop throwing out bad photos… you’ll be amazed to see what it can do to photos that you’d typically consider unusable, like shots that came out too dark.\n\nScene Modes\nMost modern digital cameras all have scene modes to help you get the best photos for your particular situation. With Camera+, you get to choose from several scene modes including Food, Sunset, Night, Portrait, Beach, and many more.\n\nEffects\nProfessional photographer, Lisa Bettany created a slew of stunningly beautiful effects. Make your photos shimmer with “HDR”… get down and dirty with “Grunge”… fill your pics with emotion and despair with “So Emo”. And this is just the tip of the iceberg… there are dozens of 1-touch effects for you to experiment with.\n\nLightbox\nAll the pics you take in Camera+ go in the innovative Lightbox where you can quickly and easily skim through them and get rid of bad shots. You save only the photos you’re satisfied with so that your camera roll stays neat and clean.\n\nSharing\nWhether you want to show your results to your friends and family or the whole world, Camera+ has got you covered. Proudly share your photos on Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr. Or go the more personal route and email or message them from right within the app.\n\niCloud Lightbox sync\nAutomatically sync your Camera+ photos between all of your devices. Shoot all day on your iPhone… and then edit at night on your iPad. \n\nCrops\nIf you didn’t line-up your shot perfectly when you took it, you can easily fix that with Camera+. And when you want to get a bit creative, we setup a bunch of popular crop sizes for you. With a single tap, you can make your pics square, 4×6, 8×10, and more.\n\nBorders\nWith Camera+ you get several great border designs, from simple black and white borders to more gritty designs, you’ll be able to add wonderful finishing touches.\n\nCaptions\nHave some fun with your photos by putting captions on them. It’s a great way to really personalize your favorite shots.",

This was inspired by TrueCrypt and makes brute force attacks longer. The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher, key size or cipher mode of operation.\n• Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\n• The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\n• Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.\n\nFor more info see http://www.awallet.org/\n\nIf you like this App, rate it in the App Store.

You can browse the bhajan list by deity or album. If you already have the audio track on your device, it starts playing and highlights the word in karaoke style. It gives a easy Buy button to itunes for those albums not on your device.\n\nYou may forward or rewind the highlighting and audio by using the slider below the bhajan text area. \n\nContinued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.",

    "description": "The Guitar Note Trainer is an app to help you learn the notes on the guitar neck - one of the most essential skills for progressing guitarists!\n\nIt has four training modes, Name The Note where you have to name the note shown on the neck, Find A Note where you have to find a given note on the neck in all 6 positions, Memory Quiz 1 where you have to name a note having been given it's position, and Memory Quiz 2 where you must name all the notes across a given fret (a tough one!!).\n\nThere are some \"Easy\" options for those just starting out to limit your range of answers.\n\nYou also have an audio option to hear the notes as you select them!\n\nIf you really need to cheat you can swipe your finger diagonally across the fretboard and all the notes will show for a second :)\n\nI'm sure you'll find this app very helpful, all you need to add is practice time!\n\nBest wishes, Justin",

These frequencies can be induced in the brain indirectly by playing two different audible tones into each ear, which after being processed by the brain, are perceived as an inaudible beat matching the target brainwave frequency. As you listen, your own brainwaves fall into step with this inaudible beat, and after a few minutes synchronize with the target brainwave frequency. Brain Wave's 35 programs layer these binaural sequences into multi-stage sessions to help users focus and concentrate, feel positive and motivated, and sleep more soundly.\n\n- To use Brain Wave with Spotify or an Audio Book Reader start the other app first and then ours. To listen with a podcast, start Brain Wave first.\n\n- Program duration is fully adjustable. If the program has multiple Binaural Stages the individual stages will be lengthened or shortened accordingly. \n\n- Programs use composite Binaural Tones that stimulate multiple brainwave frequencies to create combination experiences, such as Problem Solving, Power Nap, Pre-Exercise Energy, Dreamy Sleep, and Positive Mood Boost.\n\n- Each program goes through a progression of binaural beats, each for a specific period of time sufficient to synchronize your brainwaves with the binaural tones. \n\n*** Features ***\n\n- 35 Advanced Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Programs to use throughout the day.\n\n- Multiple program durations (10 min, 20 min, 30 min, 40 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours). You can also set your own custom duration.\n\n- Use the included Ambience or create a playlist of your own iTunes Music to use with each program. Your brain will process the binaural frequencies played over these background sounds. Binaural Tones are more effective with background audio than alone.\n\n- Save preferred settings, including background audio, iTunes playlist, Alarm settings, and volume for each Brainwave Program.\n\n- Choose from one of the 10 gentle alarm sounds, or select your own iTunes Music track.\n\n** 35 Included Binaural Brainwave Entrainment Programs **\n\n- Morning Coffee\n- Espresso Shot\n- Morning Meditation\n- Focused and Alert\n- Critical Thinking\n- Concentration\n- Memory Boost\n- Problem Solving\n- Brainstorm\n- Confidence Boost\n- Pre-Exercise Energy\n- Creativity Boost\n- Positive Mood Boost\n- Motivation Boost\n- Euphoria\n- Stress Reduction\n- Anger Relief\n- Calm Reflection\n- Reduce Anxiety\n- Deep Relaxation\n- Meditation\n- Lucid Dreaming\n- Dreamy Sleep\n- Power Nap\n- Deep Sleep\n- Deep Sleep with Wake-up Stage\n- Dreamy Sleep with Wake-up Stage\n- Headache Relief\n- Hangover Relief\n- Yoga Meditation\n- Alpha Relaxation\n- Theta Meditation\n- Gamma Power Nap\n- Night Meditation\n- Night Reading\n\n** Included Backgrounds **\n\n- Beach Surf\n- Ocean Waves \n- Ocean Waves 2\n- Rain and Thunder\n- Atmospheres: Serenity\n- Atmospheres: Awakening\n- Atmospheres: Space\n- Atmospheres: Drifting\n- Atmospheres: Peace\n- Atmospheres: Floating\n- Atmospheres: Soaring\n- Medium Rain\n- Light Rain \n- Waterfall \n- Flowing Creek \n- Pink Noise\n- Forest\n\n* Binaural Brainwave entrainment should not be used while driving or operating machinery.",

    "description": "\"If you've not already played this brilliant, heart-wrenching game, then mobile is as good a place as any to let it completely destroy you.\" - , 9/10, Pocket Gamer UK\n\n\"This War of Mine isn’t exactly “fun,” but it’s definitely a game worth playing.\" , 9/10, 148apps\n\n\"I'm really excited to go home and download 11 bit studios' title on my iPad\" , Game Informer\n\nIn This War Of Mine you do not play as an elite soldier, rather a group of civilians trying to survive in a besieged city; struggling with lack of food, medicine and constant danger from snipers and hostile scavengers. The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival. The sooner you realize that, the better.\n\nThis War of Mine: Anniversary Edition\nIt's been two years since This War of Mine global release and we're still expanding the experience. This new free DLC, created especially for the Anniversary Edition, adds new characters, new locations to explore, and most importantly - a whole new ending, leading to a different outcome to the game. The dilemma though remains the same – how far will you go, to protect the ones you care about? \n\nKey Features:\n• Inspired by real-life events \n• Control your survivors and manage your shelter \n• Craft weapons, alcohol, beds or stoves – anything that helps you survive \n• Make decisions - an often unforgiving and emotionally difficult experience \n• Randomized world and characters every time you start a new game \n• Charcoal-stylized aesthetics to complement the game's theme\n\nThis War of Mine experience is now broadened with \"The Little Ones\" expansion. \"The Little Ones\" explores the hardships of wartime survival as seen from an entirely new perspective―that of a child. This DLC puts you in charge of a group of adults and children stuck in a besieged city, struggling with basic necessities. TWoM: The Little Ones focuses not only on the reality of enduring war, but also on how even in times of conflict, kids are still kids: they laugh, cry, play, and see the world differently. In addition to thinking about survival, you'll have to summon your inner child to understand how to protect the little ones. Their youth, and their future, are in your hands.\n\n• Experience the biggest expansion to This War of Mine\n• Protect innocent children\n• Craft toys, play with kids, and be the caretaker they need\n• Meet new adult civilians in scenarios with children\n\nPLEASE NOTE: This game is optimized for latest devices. While playing on older devices such as iPhone 4s or iPad 2 you might experience lower frame rates.",

    "description": "Every musician should work on Ear Training (or Aural Training) and Interval Ear Training is a very important element of ear training. To put it very simply, you will learn to recognise the relationship between two notes (by distance), when they are played together or apart!\n\nThere are two types of interval listening, harmonic and melodic. In harmonic intervals the notes are played at the same time and in melodic the notes are played one after the other. Easy to remember: Melodic Intervals make melody, Harmonic Intervals make harmony!\n\nMany of you will probably want to understand how the names are found and how to work out the interval note names in every key. For this info you probably want to check out my ebook Practical Music Theory (available from justinguitar.com) which will explain all the theory related to this.\n\nThis app deals specifically with Interval Ear Training, both melodic and harmonic. It will start very easy and gradually get harder as you get more correct and can pass each stage. You can choose from Piano or Guitar Input for your answers, and you can chose to hear the notes and guitar or piano. Personally, I'd recommend getting used to both. In \"Training Mode\" you can select specific intervals to work on if you are struggling with just specific intervals or types of interval.\n\nI'm sure you'll find this app very helpful, all you need to add is practice time! \n\nBest wishes, Justin",

    "description": "Learn to play 'In The Pocket' with Drummer ITP: The World's only intelligent metronome and rudiment training tool! *Worldwide Number 1 iPhone Music App in over 70 countries!*\n\nDrummer ITP can help you to learn exceptionally accurate timing with your drum performances and become a true 'In The Pocket' player. The app is designed for practicing rudiment patterns with a drum practice pad - incorporating an intelligent listening feature, which allows your performance against a metronome click to be measured and given as feedback scores. You can therefore track your progress and identify what rudiment patterns and tempos cause you most trouble with staying in time. \n\n*Please note: as with all professional audio and recording systems, Drummer ITP requires you to use wired headphones to enable zero latency analysis and measurements. Bluetooth headphones do not allow zero latency data exchange.\n\nDrummer ITP helps to identify the key tempos where your technique changes from wrist-action stick hits to faster speeds which require you to control the bounce of the drumsticks. Finding your breaking points with different stick pad rudiments and practice exercises will enable you to focus on the most challenging aspects of your personal stick technique and will underpin your development in all areas of drumming.\n\nThe main display shows both the rolling click waveform and the microphone readings from your performance on the practice pad, so you can easily see if you are playing ahead or behind the beat. There is also a unique accuracy indicator which shows how far ahead or behind the beat each of your hits is. Whilst performing rudiments and exercises on a practice pad, the app records an ongoing measurement of accuracy and consistency of the performance, so you can practice to keep the timing indicator right in the middle of the screen and achieve the highest possible scores. When playing an accented pattern, or an exercise with rests incorporated, the intelligent algorithm checks that the correct type of hits are performed at the right time. If you want to check how accurate the app is, just turn up the loudspeaker volume and you'll see it measure its own sounds to 100% accuracy - so you can see how close your own performance scores are to that of an electronic drum machine!\n\nDrummer ITP can be used in Manual Mode or Rudiment Mode. In Manual Mode the metronome runs freely, as a standard metronome whilst also keeping a measurement of the recent performance scores. With a rudiment pattern active (i.e. using the app's Rudiment Mode), a count in starts a 30, 60, 120 or 300 second rudiment test, the results of which become a benchmark for evaluating your performance progress over time, with all your best high scores being recorded. The app can also be used purely as a standalone high-precision metronome with advanced settings allowing you to choose different pitches, volumes and intervals for the click.\n\nIncludes a total of 68 practice patterns and rudiment exercises for combinations of:\n- standard timing exercises (quarters, eighths, sixteenths)\n- triplet timing exercises\n- single, double and triple paradiddles (including inverted, reverse and offset)\n- single and double paradiddle-diddle patterns\n- rudimental drum rolls\n- accented patterns\n\nAdditional features:\n- notation of all included rudiments and exercise patterns \n- real-time left/right hand pattern indicator \n- accent indicator and moving notation counter \n- tempo adjustment from 30-240 bpm\n- beat time intervals 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8\n- optional beat one accent for practicing specific time signatures\n- click designer with settings for pitch, tonality, click duration and volume\n- separate click design for the main beat and interval sounds\n- stick pad performance player, to hear what you are attempting to play\n- high scores chart for completed rudiments and exercises\n- preset click sounds\n- microphone sensitivity adjustment\n- intelligent 'learn latency' feature to ensure 100% accurate analysis",
