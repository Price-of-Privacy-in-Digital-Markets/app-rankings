    "description": "DoubleTake by FiLMiC transforms your iPhone into a multi-cam studio allowing you to capture video from two cameras at the same time on recent devices*\n\n*NOTE:  Per iOS 13 capabilities, multi-cam video is restricted to the following devices only:  iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro, 11, Xs Max, Xs, Xr, SE 2. iPad Pro 2018 and 2020.  While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 13, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nDoubleTake gives you an early look at the multi-cam capability that will be coming to our award-winning cinema camera app FiLMiC Pro.  \n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll.",

You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad.

I bet this app will make you smile or laugh at least once.\n\nMy name is Vince Kotchian, and I've been a GRE prep tutor since 2008. In this app, I've created flashcards for over 1300 GRE words and 160 word roots. Each vocab flashcard has a silly cartoon, a clear definition of the word with an example sentence, and a memorable mnemonic to make it easier to remember the word. \n\nHere's a mnemonic example so you know what I'm talking about: \"prodigal\" means \"wasteful\". The prodigal Prada gal spent $1500 on a pair of Prada boots. Get it? :)\n\nThe app's smart spaced repetition system shows you words when you need to review them to make your GRE vocabulary studying more efficient and effective. There's also a streak feature to help keep you motivated to use the app consistently.

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength.

    "description": "If you've ever wanted to use your iPhone camera as a video & audio input to stream using OBS Studio, we've got you covered. We've tried all the apps that let you do it over WiFi, but they're not fast enough, so we also allow you to use a wired USB connection.\n\nQUALITY VIDEO\nYour iPhone/iPad camera's are good, really good. In fact, there’s no comparison between the highly recommended streaming webcam, the Logitech C922 HD Pro and the iPhone 6 Camera. Stream Landscape or Portrait video.\n\nAUDIO\nIf you don't have a separate mic for your streaming setup, you can now use the microphone on your iOS device to stream audio & video.\n\nFRONT CAMERA\nStream a selfie with the front camera support. Switch anytime during the stream with the familiar camera switch button.\n\nTAP TO FOCUS, PINCH TO ZOOM\nControls just like you're used to from the Camera app.\n\nMANUAL CONTROLS\nTake control of the focus, exposure, white balance as you would on a manual DSLR camera.\n\nLOW LATENCY\nStream video over a wired USB connection. This avoids the issue of delay over wifi, as many other solutions suffer from. This is just as fast as a USB webcam!\n\nUSB & WIFI\nChoose the connection type. If you want low latency, use USB, if you'd like portability then use WiFi. WiFi is done using the NewTek™ NDI® protocol, so you can use Camera for OBS Studio with any NewTek™ NDI® compatible receiver.\n\nMULTIPLE DEVICES\nIf you're lucky enough to own multiple iOS devices, use them together and produce a multi-camera stream.\n\nMAC AND PC\nSupports OBS Studio running on macOS and Windows.\n\nYou will need to install the OBS Studio iOS Camera Plugin from our website, or use an NDI compatible receiver to use this app.\n\nFor the best possible experience make sure your device is listed on our website https://obs.camera/docs/faqs/#what-ios-hardware-do-i-need",

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

Other features like \"Full Athan\" and \"Custom Athan\" are supported only when the app is ope. This is because of technical limitations. We will try to fix it once iOS system allows it.\n\nNote about Athan :\n-----------------\nSalatuk remind you that it's time for prayer with a \"4 takbeerats\" instead of full Athan. Because of technical limitations, it's possible to play full Athan only if the app is open. \n\nAlso, if you have problems to hear the notifications, please make sure to enable the following parameters in your device :\n\n1) Settings>Sounds>Alerts \n2) Settings>Notifications>Salatuk \n3) Your phone is not on mute and volume is correct\n\nNote about Prayers times :\n-----------------------------------\nPlease note that we pay attention to ensure that the prayer times of Salatuk are accurate.
