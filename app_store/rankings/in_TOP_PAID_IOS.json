The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

    "description": "Obscura 3 is a camera app packed full of features to help you take incredible photos. Obscura pairs a stunning design with intuitive controls that make taking photos a delight.\n—\n\nObscura 2 has been featured numerous times by Apple around the world, including as Editor’s Choice and App of the Day. And Obscura 3 is even better.\n—\n\nDesign\n\nObscura squeezes a bunch of powerful features into simple controls anyone can master. The interface balances aesthetics, ergonomics, and intuitiveness. You won’t want to use anything else. All the camera controls can be reached with one thumb, and gestures and haptics combine to create a tactile experience that lets you stay focused on your subject.\n—\n\nAppearance\nThemes, manual light and dark modes, custom app icons. All gorgeous. \n—\n\n\nCamera Features\n—\n\nModes\nObscura 3 has been designed around 5 distinct camera modes: \nPhoto - simple, fast performance\nPro Photo - maximum control \nDepth - portraits & depth data\nLive Photo - for.. Live Photos\nVideo - video capture with pro controls\n\nExposure\nTo adjust exposure, just touch your thumb to the Exposure Button and move it in a circle, like turning a dial. Couldn’t be simpler and it feels great. And you can just tap the button to instantly reset the exposure bias.\n\nFocus\nJust like exposure, drag your thumb around the Focus Button to focus manually. And you’ll get both a focus loupe and focus peaking to help you get your subject perfectly crisp. ^1\n\nISO & Shutter Speed\nTK\n\nWhite Balance\nAWB, White Point, Scene Presets, and manual Temp + Tint.\n\nPhoto Formats\nProRAW ^2, RAW, HEIC, and JPEG photos, Live Photos and Depth Data ^3. \n\nVideo Formats\n1080p or 4K at 24,30 or 60fps ^4\n\nFilters\nLots of new filters, some old favorites. You can now disable filters and set favorites for quick access. All included.\n\nAspect Ratio\nCapture photos in 4:3, 1:1, 16:9, and 2:1 aspect ratios.\n\nHistogram\nSmall or large, luminance or color.\n\nGrid\nLines, crosshairs, or none.\n\nSpirit Level\nFor perfectly level horizons that would make Wes Anderson proud.\n\nFlash\nYep.\n\nTimer\nI hear tick tock is really popular with the youths.\n\nPresets\nCustomise Obscura to your heart’s content, and save those customisations into presets to quickly access at any time.\n—\n \nLibrary\n\nNot only has the camera interface been redesigned, but the library has been reconsidered from the ground up to give you quick access to your most important photos, without sacrificing performance.\n—\n\nView Options\nObscura lets you configure exactly what’s displayed in the library views, so you can hide screenshots and memes to help you focus on your photos.\n\nYou can also adjust the size of thumbnails to suit your preference. And keep hidden photos hidden. Naturally.\n—\n\nImage View & Editing\nBrowse, share, fav, rate, edit. Whether you want to dig into metadata, triage through your vacation photos, or apply some cool filters, you’ll find it here.\n—\n\n\nSettings & More\nObscura’s Settings has a bunch of options, allowing you to manage filters, tweak camera behaviours, change the theme, read the walkthrough and more.\n—\n\nApple Watch Support\nUse your Apple Watch as a camera remote. You can change capture mode, set exposure and more!\n—\n\nGame Controller Support\nYes, you can use a game controller to capture photos.\n———\n\n\n1. Manual Focus only available in single camera modes, not while using a Virtual Dual or Triple camera. Yes, this sucks but the virtual cameras are weird and full of quirks\n2. ProRAW only available on iPhone 12 Pro and 13 Pro\n3. Depth Data only available on Dual, Triple, or TrueDepth Camera systems\n4. Video formats vary by device\n\nThanks for checking out Obscura. If you decide to buy, we hope you’ll consider rating it, or sharing with someone you think might like it. \n\nAll the best,\nBen & Adam",

    "description": "Your pocket app for removing unwanted stuff from photos on the go. It gives your photos a clean look while saving you valuable time.\n\nAn accidental object, even though it may look tiny and harmless, can completely ruin the entire composition of a photo and make it worthless. However, it’s not a pain if you have your favorite TouchRetouch at hand.\n\nHere at ADVA Soft, we never stop creating. We are constantly developing new technologies and features to improve TouchRetouch both functionally and visually. The most recent additions, such as the mesh removal feature, new algorithm for edge-aware object removal, and a few more great new things, reflect the needs expressed by you and reveal our appreciation of your loyalty.\n\nBelow you'll find more details on what features TouchRetouch has to offer.\n\nADVANTAGES:\n\n• No subscriptions, ads, and in-app purchases\n• No personal information requests\n• No quality and EXIF data loss\n• Professional photo edits with ease\n\nNOTE\n\nThe automatic object removal algorithm works best on uniform backgrounds.\n\nWhat magic can you do with TouchRetouch?\n\n• Remove wires, power lines, and other linear objects\n• Eliminate objects like street signs, trash cans, stop lights\n• Get rid of meshes in the foreground\n• Remove background people\n• Erase pimples, skin blemishes, and wrinkles in the most natural way\n• Clean up travel photos\n• Remove text from Instagram and Snapchat posts\n• Restore old photos\n\nHow will you create magic in your photos?\n\nSINGLE-TOUCH RETOUCH\n\nThe app works great for quick retouches.\nMake minor imperfections disappear just by marking them. It takes seconds for the app to remove small details that ruin your photos.\n\nIf the task is to erase a line from your pic, mark only a section of the line or just tap it to remove it completely; no need to be precise — the app will find the line! In the manual retouch mode, all lines have control points, thus giving you more control and flexibility over adjusting curved segments.\n\nOBJECT REMOVAL LIKE MAGIC\n\nThe app declutters your images in a matter of seconds. That could either be people or other background details you may need to erase. Use automatic content removal with the Brush tool or, when the result is not that perfect, manual retouching with the Clone Stamp tool to repair a photo. \n\nAUTOMATIC MESH DETECTION AND REMOVAL\n\nIf you think that \"getting past the mesh netting\" is quite a challenging task, you probably haven’t tried using TouchRetouch yet. The app offers a way to deal with the problem in two simple steps. Select the tool from the main menu and tap the Go button to have the mesh removed just like magic. The whole detection and selection work between these two steps is done by the algorithm; no action is required on your part.\n\nHELPFUL TUTORIALS\n\nCheck out the in-app tutorials and play around a bit with the app to learn how to get the most out of it.\nLittle effort and experience are needed to become a pro in using TouchRetouch. The interface and layout are clear and intuitive enough to make you feel comfortable the very first time you use it.\n\nDownload TouchRetouch now to harness photo magic from your pocket.\n\nTouchRetouch is brought to you by ADVA Soft — a team of like-minded professionals and enthusiastic innovators committed to designing intelligent yet simple apps that create magic in your photos and save you time. Visit our website at www.adva-soft.com to learn more about the company and the apps it develops.\n\nFor any assistance with TouchRetouch, contact ADVA Soft Support at touchretouch@adva-soft.com.

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

And now iTanpura also includes fantastic Swar Mandal sound (with presets for 75+ raags) for an instant concert atmosphere guaranteed to inspire! iTanpura is ideal for everyday music practice, concerts, or even as a serene background for meditation.\n________________________________________\n\n◆ KEY FEATURES ◆\n√ FOUR fantastic instruments in one app: includes two 5-string tanpuras with independent pan and volume controls, a 15-string Swar Mandal, and a Sur-Peti/Shruti Box\n√ Uses sounds sampled from actual male & female tanpuras for realistic tanpura sound throughout the pitch range\n√ Wide range of pitch from lower A (A2) through upper E (E4) for one and a half octaves of tuning\n√ INTEGRATED AUTO-TUNER: Auto-Tune iTanpura to your instrument such as harmonium, or use it to tune other instruments (microphone capability required such as iPhone built-in mic or 2nd/3rd generation iPod Touch with external microphone)\n√ BACKGROUND PLAY: Start playing the tanpuras and switch to another app, or play along with iPod music\n√ Integrated 15-string Swar Mandal - completely tunable & can be played manually OR set to auto-loop\n√ Suitable for Hindustani or Carnatic, vocal or instrumental music \n√ Fine-tune pitch in cents.

And now you can also export/import presets via email or iTunes File Sharing.\n√ Turn the Sur-Peti/Shruti Box on or off and adjust its volume from the settings page\n√ Can be used with speakers, headset, or the internal speaker (a high-quality speaker dock is recommended for maximum effect)\n________________________________________\n\nNot yet convinced?

    "description": "Sugar is in everything these days, from boxed cereals to pasta sauces; it's almost impossible to avoid unless you're eating a real food diet. The 7 Day Sugar-Free Detox was designed by the Young and Raw team of expert nutritionists and holistic health coaches to create a fun and cleansing experience for you while you break free from the chains of sugar. \n\nStudies show sugar can be highly addictive, so rest assured we've got your back when it comes to kicking it for good! Inside this detox, you're going to find two meal plans to choose from. Our Low-Sugar Plan has small amounts of natural sugar found in fruits. Our No-Sugar Plan is completely sugar free.\n\nRefined or processed sugar is incomplete in its nutrient profile, lacking minerals and vitamins required by our bodies for digestion. What ends up happening when we eat sugar, is our bodies have to seek out the proper minerals required for digestion and unfortunately, those minerals are \"borrowed\" from our mineral reserves. This can lead to mineral deficiency and other health issues that are today, considered \"modern diseases\". \n\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox is designed to support:\n- Breaking sugar addiction\n- Weight loss\n- Liver & Kidney detox\n- Skin health \n- Balancing blood sugar \n- Mood balancing\n- Energy levels\n- Adrenal fatigue\n\nInside the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox you will find:\n- Low-Sugar Meal Plan which includes some fruit sugars\n- No-Sugar Meal Plan which is 100% sugar free\n- Recipes - along with a list of health benefits for each recipe\n- Shopping lists - to make shopping quick and easy, you can tick off items from the list\n- Morning and evening routines - including how to get a perfect night of sleep\n- Young and Raw's favorite books, quotes & documentaries\n- Frequently Asked Questions\n\nHow does the plan work to reset the body?\nThe 7 Day Sugar Free Detox was carefully crafted by experts to get you results while maintaining your sanity throughout the process! \n\nBy replacing sugar with fresh leafy greens, vegetables, seaweeds and seeds along with an abundance of healthy fats, your body will be less hungry for sugar. In the beginning, you may notice a withdrawal period as your body adjusts to running off of fat and real food rather than sugar and carbohydrates. Be patient with yourself throughout this process, it's not easy, but we know you can do it!\n\nThe meal plans have everything you need to detox, and because there are no added or refined sugars your liver and kidneys will get a much needed break from processed sugar.\n\nFor 7 days you're going to experience what it's like to enjoy only real, whole foods but don't forget that diet is only one part of the equation. Proper detox also includes getting enough fresh clean water and optimizing your sleep. Our sleep cycles ensure the body gets its time to effectively detox, renew and heal. The included sleep protocol was designed based on all of the information we have about the importance of optimized sleep and the experiments we have done, to create a protocol that really works. \n\nYour herbal protocol is always optional and if you're on any medications, pregnant or have a health condition, it's advised that you speak with your physician and consult an herbalist prior to taking new supplements. The herbal protocol is minimal yet powerful, including some of the most elite herbs for detoxing the liver, kidneys, creating clear skin and boosting energy in the process. \n\nIn Summary, the 7 Day Sugar Free Detox helps to reset the body by:\n- Gently cleansing the body and promoting toxin elimination\n- Gently introducing blood cleansing foods\n- Providing the body with enough healthy fats to begin removing a reliance upon sugar and processed carbohydrates\n- Encouraging a healthy sleep cycle \n- Creates a movement routine to stimulate the lymphatic system, the endocrine system and the detox organs\n- Hydrating effectively to flush the body of excess toxins and create electrolyte balance",

    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",
