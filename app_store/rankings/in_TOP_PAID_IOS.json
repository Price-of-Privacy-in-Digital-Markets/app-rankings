    "description": "AnkiMobile is a mobile companion to Anki, a powerful, intelligent flashcard program that is free, multi-platform, and open-source. Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile was written by the lead developer of Anki and AnkiWeb, and it has been around since 2010. Beware other apps using \"Anki\" in their name that have sprung up recently - they are not compatible with the rest of the Anki ecosystem, and they offer far fewer features.\n\nSome of AnkiMobile's features include:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

AutoSleep will track your sleep & quality and send you a notification in the morning.\n\nEven if you don't wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep can track your time in bed. It's extremely simple.\n\nIf you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher.

Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll.",

The application could reduce the size of Video to 5 MB, 10MB, 15 MB and etc.\n\nIn order to use the application, just specify the size of the video in MB that you want to achieve and it will compress the video to that size.\n\nThere are various places where reducing the Video size helps.For example, in emails the attachment sizes are limited to 25 MB.In such cases the large videos could be compressed to 25 MB and sent across emails.\n\nMany messaging platforms like WhatsApp do not allow large sized videos to be shared.In such scenarios, we have to often cut a part of the video to send and we are unable to send the full video.\nUsing Video Size Compressor you will be able to overcome this problem. Using the application , you will be able to reduce the file size of the entire video to a smaller size. After this, you will be able to share the entire video easily without cutting any part of it.\n\nSmaller sized videos also help to upload them to a website and could be transferred easily using file sharing services and pen drives.If you are a website owner, you could offer different sizes of the same video to your customers.This will help them to download the video as per their requirements. \n\nThe compressed videos also help to save the space on phone, harddisk or the pen drives wherever they are used.\n\nThe application itself is very easy to use.The videos could be compressed using the application in 3 easy steps.\n\nIn order to compress the video, just select it from gallery ,specify the required size and click on \"Compress Video\" button.The application will reduce the video size and it will save it to gallery.It will also display a share page using which you will be able to share the video directly with various other applications and services like WhatsApp, iCloud, Mail, AirDrop,Save to Files,Cloud services and many more.",

    "description": "First released in 2009, GoodReader® is truly a veteran of the App Store.\n\nIn the modern app business, it's not easy to stay relevant that long. We're proud to say that after 12 years and counting, we've been delivering wonderful updates with extraordinary new features. And we're going to keep doing that!\n\nGoodReader is a perfect combination of document-reading and file-managing capabilities. It's your one-stop shop for all your document needs on your iOS device.\n\nUse the app once, and you'll be hooked. Soon you'll be wondering how you ever managed to work without it.\n\n-= File Reading =-\nPDF, TXT, MS Office, iWork, HTML, pictures, music & audio-books, videos. This is what you can view in GoodReader, plus you can also annotate PDF files and edit TXT files.\n\n-= PDF Reading and Annotating =-\nPDF files is where GoodReader truly shines. Reading experience is so superior, it's hard to describe. To rephrase one of our customers' review, \"try it, and you'll see.\" While you're at it, give our PDF Reflow feature a try. You'll be surprised how much better PDF reading goes when you don't have to scroll left/right all the time, for every single line of text.\nAnnotating PDFs is another star feature of our app. Adding notes and drawings, highlighting text, and then sharing your annotated files or annotation summaries will be your main productivity and collaboration asset.\n\n-= File Management =-\nWhile reading files is a big part of GoodReader, it's not all it can do. It can also serve as a central hub for all your files, even those that can't be opened by GoodReader itself. It's like bringing your personal computer experience to your mobile device — easily managing huge collections of files and folders will make you forget you don't have your laptop around.\n\n-= Connecting =-\nDropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive, Box.com, WebDAV, SMB, AFP, FTP, SFTP — these are all accessible from inside GoodReader. Download, upload, and sync individual files or huge folder collections.\n\n-= Security =-\nWith GoodReader, your data security steps up to the level previously only dreamt of. With Pro Pack® (*), our new set of professional-level super-features, you'll get AES-256, a military-grade encryption, for all your data, at a price of a cup of coffee! And it's completely independent from the built-in Apple's Data Protection, so even if a hacker steals and unlocks your device, your data will still be protected by another strong layer of security, our own.\n\n-= Split-Screen =-\nA part of the Pro Pack (*) add-on, this wonderful new feature allows you to split an iPad screen in half, to read two files side-by-side. And even two different parts of the same file!\n\n(*): Pro Pack® is a paid add-on, sold separately from inside the app, as an in-app purchase.",

Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength.

It may also be neccessary to start casting multiple times until it works with specific videos.\n\n* If a video is not working at all, please check the FAQ on the app startpage. If that does not help you, please drop us an email before leaving a negative comment on the App Store.

Survive the seemingly never-ending gauntlet of requests from your advisors, peasants, allies, and enemies while maintaining balance between the influential factions of your kingdom. But beware; each decision you make might have implications and unfortunate consequences down the road that could put your reign and family’s dynasty at risk!\n\nEach year of your reign brings another important – seemingly random – request from your unpredictable kingdom as you strive for balance between the church, the people, the army, and the treasury. Prudent decisions and careful planning make for a long reign but unforeseen motivations, surprise events, and poor luck can take down even the most entrenched monarch. Extend your reign as long as possible, forge alliances, make enemies, and find new ways to die as your dynasty marches along through the ages. Some events will span on centuries, with an intrigue involving burning witches, scientific enlightenment, wicked politics and, maybe, the Devil himself.\n\n*iPhone 5 / iPod Touch 6 / iPad Mini / iPad Air or later recommended.",

It's a different way of looking at the day\n\nHOW IT WORKS\n\nThe visual planner works like an analog clock widget. It automatically receives all the calendar events and overlays them on the 12/24 hour dial. This provides a different, more efficient view of your schedule.\n\nHOW IT LOOKS\n\nIt looks like a projection of your calendar of events onto a 12-hour dial that has hour and minute hands just like a regular watch.\nEvent sectors are displayed in those hour intervals in which they will occur.\nThe interval of idle time between events is displayed between sectors, as well as the time from an hour hand to the start of each event.\nEvents are displayed automatically 12/24 hours ahead of time.\n\nThe calendar and analog clock, combined, give a visual representation of your busyness, allow you to effectively plan and calculate daytime.\n\nUse a widget for better integration.\n\nAREAS OF APPLICATION\n\n• Day scheduling and timing. Conveniently track your daily tasks, meetings, events and at any time know how much time is left to wait until the end of the current event and until the start of the next. Don't be late.\n\n• Accounting and control of working hours. Keep your phone in your workplace and you will be completely under control.\n\n• Class schedule. Observe how much time is left before the end of a tiresome lecture at the university and never be late for laboratory work.\n\n• Schedule of the day. Follow your daily routine and get better, just use the app to keep track of your to-dos and daily tasks. Take rest breaks in time!\n\n• Trip timer and flight duration. Are you losing the passage of time due to endless travel and flights? Control check-in time, boarding time and flight duration. Keep everything under control.\n\n• Make your meal, medication, and exercise schedule clearer. Lead the right lifestyle and be healthy!\n\n• Convenient countdown to scheduled events in the app and widget. The plan of the day will be executed exactly.\n\n• The app may appeal to fans of Pomodoro and Chronodex timer technologies. Time tracking with him will happen in a new way.",

    "description": "Theodolite is a multi-function viewfinder that combines a compass, two-axis inclinometer, rangefinder, GPS, map, nav calculator, and geo-overlay photo/movie camera into one indispensable app. Theodolite was one of the very first augmented reality (AR) apps when it was released in 2009, and it’s been downloaded and used by millions of customers since then. Uses are endless, and the app is great for land measurements, outdoor sports, sightseeing, navigation, and finding your way around. Theodolite is a pro grade app and is used extensively by surveyors, geologists, architects, engineers, competitive sportsmen, first responders, military personnel, and search and rescue workers around the world. \n\nTheodolite lets you take data-overlay photos and movies with 2X-8X zoom. Overlay geographical data, angle markings, date/time, author/company info, and project notes directly on photos and movies for later reference. The same data is written into the metadata record of images, making image files self-contained data records. Third-party apps can tap into Theodolite's advanced camera functions with a camera sharing feature.\n\nView current position on the built-in map with optional offline Outdoors maps that include topo contours, roads, trails, landmarks, campgrounds, ski lifts, and more. Live map markers continually update distance/heading relative to the current location and also show wayfinding info in the main viewfinder. Draw polygons on the map to mark things like property boundaries and trails, and import/export polygon data via KML.\n\nShare map markers and nav calculator points with other users of Theodolite via text messages or e-mail. This powerful capability opens up a wide range of collaborative uses including team land surveying, accident investigations, spotting wild fires, triangulation of landmarks, and advanced tactical observation and targeting. With an optional in-app purchase to enable team tracking, you can share location with up to 20 people on Theodolite's map.\n\nTheodolite includes features for serious users like a reference angle mode, nav calculator, map marker import/export, manual and automatic data logging with CSV and KML export, clipboard integration, %grade display, mil compass readout, optical rangefinders (including a mil-based reticle, sniper-style stadiametric graphs, and a variable 4X-24X scope), and night filters to improve use in dark conditions.\n\nTheodolite can provide location in military grid reference system (MGRS) coordinates, Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) coordinates, British/Irish National Grids, US National Grid, Maidenhead locator system, Map Grid of Australia, and six latitude/longitude formats. Optional US State Plane coordinates include SPCS27 and SPCS83 zones covering all US States. The optional Datum Pack adds over 230 geodetic datums to the app to improve position computation from GPS data, covering regions and countries on all continents around the world.\n\nAR Layers include navigational aids like the sun, moon, and Polaris (North star), and the optional US Mountain Summits layer that shows over 70,000 US mountain summits in the viewfinder.\n\nTheodolite has been shown in Apple Keynotes, featured on the App Store, and has been a #1 selling Navigation app in App Stores around the world. Since its introduction in 2009, Theodolite has defined augmented reality navigation. The app continually introduces new technologies, pushing the limits of iOS app development and taking advantage of new hardware capabilities.\n\nFind out why Apple named Theodolite one of the most amazing apps available and showed it being used to explore the Great Wall of China. Where will you take it on your next adventure?\n\nNote: Theodolite is an iPhone app -- see “Theodolite HD” for use on an iPad. And be sure to check out the all-new \"Theodolite for Watch\" and put Theodolite on your wrist!",

You are one of the few that have survived and now you must to fight for your life against what is left of the indigenous population now infected with the disease. In best traditions of survival and horror games, players in \"The Survivor\" must explore the open world to gather raw materials to build their own weapons, tools, fortifications, shelters, etc. against the dangers of the zombies, infected wildlife and the world itself.\n\nThe only aim in \"The Survivor\" is to survive. To do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger, thirst, cold and radiation.\n► Craft weapons and tools. Chop down trees in the forest to build a camp, or start a fire to keep warm.\n► Don't starve! Kill animals for meat. Scavenge food to keep yourself from starving.\n► Build a small shelter or a large fortress. Lay traps and defences to keep a safe perimeter.\n► Explore and build during the day. Defend your base at night.\n\nKey features:\n► Random world generation - 1 sq. km chunk of post soviet state randomized with abandoned villages, military bases, deep forests, roads, rivers, lakes, wilderness locations, and more...\n► Day and night - Realistic dynamic day and night cycle with sun and moon phases.\n► Create and destroy - The world structures and items can be destroyed or scrapped for resources. Re-purpose collected materials to build custom structures and fortification by hand, placing building pieces into the world in real time.\n► Inventory - Carry all of the items that you will need to survive in the intuitive inventory system developed to answer the needs of crafting and character customization.\n► Item crafting and degradation - In the apocalyptic world of \"The Survivor\", resources are sparse and every useful bit should be utilized. With a continually growing list of recipes, gather resources such as wood, stone and rust metal to create weapons and tools. As your tools wear out over time, use your crafting skills to repair them. Items or equipment can be improved, turned into something else or fixed using the new crafting mechanisms.\n► Animals - Head out into the wilderness to hunt animals once the abandoned buildings are already plundered.\n► Stealth system - Sneak past zombies and animals who can see, hear and smell you.\n► Environmental temperature - Build/find shelter or campfire. Cold nights or long days will make a difference.\n\nOfficial page on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/tsrfo",

The sensor is very sensitive. \n\nPerfect to use at the airport, your office, library, or in any place where you will leave your device unattended for a short while. \n\nYou can also use the app as an alarm for power surge/failure when your battery is really low and you depend on your wake-up call. Works even better with the new Volume control.\n\nAlso works if your power pack loses all the power.\n\n(When using for example an Apple Smart Power Case, you have to use the Motion Function as an alarm since the normal function senses power loss.)\n\nWorks on wireless chargers as well.",

    "description": "Guru Gita has a prominent place in the hearts of spritual seekers. There are many devotees across the world who chant Guru Gita on a daily basis. If you ask them why they consider Guru Gita as so important, they say - \"However far away our Guru might be, 'Guru Gita' brings Him closer to our hearts, it enables us to communicate with Him\".\nSpeaking about the greatness of Guru Gita, Sri Swamiji once said, \"Guru gita does not discriminate on the basis of caste, creed, race, country or sex. it belongs to everybody. Sadguru's grace is necessary to achieve spiritual upliftment. In order to obtain Guru's grace, it is imperative for one to understand the principie of Guru. There is no treatise more useful to achieve this than the Guru Gita\".\nThere are several Gitas-Bhagavad Gita, Avadhoota Gita, Ashtavakra Gita, Shruti Gita, Vasishtha Gita - and so on. All these elaborate on Atma Thatva (knowledge of self).  All sacred scriptures have stressed the importance of a Guru for seekers who wants to know about Atma Thatva. It is only Guru Gita that explains the concept of Guru, who is verily the most important link between the seeker and the sought.\nSri Swamiji, the embodiment of compassion has Himself chanted the sacred verses of Guru Gita in this album it comes as a panacea at a time when the world is passing through very difficult times. It brings you nearer to your Guru. We urge everyone- especially today's youth- to listen to and chant these sacred verses every day.  May the grace of Sadguru help create a healthy society.",

    "description": "Meet Freya, your virtual birth partner from The Positive Birth Company! Freya will coach you through every single surge with a simple breathing technique and visualisation. She will help you relax between surges with a mix of guided relaxations, positive affirmations, gentle music and calming visualisations. Freya makes it easy for you to keep track of your surges and you can visit the log at any point to see how frequently your surges are coming and how long they are lasting. Freya will also let you know when your labour is established and when it might be a good time to contact your midwife. You will never birth alone with Freya by your side.\n \nTRACK YOUR SURGES\n\nIn hypnobirthing we refer to contractions as surges, as a ‘surge’ more accurately describes the sensation you’ll experience when in labour. Freya is the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the app store, designed specifically with hypnobirthing mums in mind, but can be used by anyone.\n \nPREPARE FOR BIRTH\n\nYou can also use Freya in pregnancy to help you relax and prepare for your birth. In fact the more you listen to the guided relaxations and positive affirmations, the more familiar they will become and the more effective they will be at helping you relax when it comes to birth. Positive affirmations have been proven to change the way your mind works and listening regularly will help you feel less anxious and more confident in the lead up to birth. \n \nTHE SCIENCE\n\nWe know the more relaxed you are during birth, the more oxytocin you will produce. Oxytocin helps your uterus to work efficiently, making labour faster and more comfortable. \n \nLIFESKILLS\n\nYou can also use Freya post-birth any time you feel you could benefit from taking some deep breaths or need some help finding your zen. Everything you learn through using Freya - mindfulness exercises, breathing techniques, the benefits of taking time out - are skills for life.\n\nIf you have any questions or spot any pesky bugs lurking about the place (!) please do let us know at help@thepositivebirthcompany.co.uk\n\nWHAT YOU’LL GET:\n\niPhone and Apple Watch app\nA timer to record your surges (also known as a contraction timer)\nCoaching audio to keep your mind focused on breathing through each surge\nA gentle expanding visualisation which you can use to sync your breathing\nA detailed log of your surges over time, so you can track your progress through labour\nAbility to easily share the log with your birth partner, midwife or doula\nGuided relaxations, positive affirmations and soothing visuals to help keep you calm and relaxed, making birth easier, quicker and more straightforward (can also be used in pregnancy and postnatally)\nCoaching created by renowned hypnobirthing expert Siobhan Miller, founder of The Positive Birth Company\n\nDownload the ONLY hypnobirthing-friendly contraction timer on the App Store and prepare to meet your baby in the best possible way, feeling calm and confident, relaxed and happy!",

    "description": "* The demo presented above is a sketch of Stevie from the Youtube show Good Mythical Morning.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens is no ordinary drawing app. It is a drawing app that helps you make real sketches on paper.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens is an augmented reality drawing app that works like an AR projector. It projects any photo you've selected from your photo library on any paper or sketch books you prefer drawing on. \n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens allows you to trace out the images you want to draw before shading. But it is more than a tracing tool, as it also allows you to capture areas of different tones and highlights - achieving a more lifelike picture. \n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens is a great tool for portrait drawing.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens can also be used in short drawing/sketching practices for beginners.\n\n◉ Vermeer's Lens enables even beginners to make stunning drawings. \n\n◉ Through its precise algorithms, what is traditionally difficult, such as portraits, can now be done without the need of construction lines.   \n\n◉ This app works on most phones without using Apple's ARKit which can only run on newer high performance chips. It's a simple effective tool for a simple hobby.\n\n*** See \"Developer's website\" below for a video demo\n\n*** A Youtube channel (see \"Developer's website\") is set up to provide you with examples of Vermeer's Lens in action. Content will be regularly uploaded so long as there are people interested in this app.\n\n*** This app works on most phones without using Apple's ARKit which can only run on newer high performance chips. It is simple, reliable and stable.\n________________________________________________________\nHow it works :\n\n> a photo is chosen from your photo library and  “projected” over the paper to draw on.\n\n> This projection is achieved by imaging the paper on the phone screen, and overlaying the translucent photo onto it.\n\n> With the phone held in a phone-holder, you can use its screen as a lens, through which you trace out the photo onto the paper.\n\n> Phone can be tilted and rotated to the angle most comfortable to you, while \"Vermeer’s Lens\" transforms the photo to match the perspective of the paper.\n\n> Not just the outlines, even the different subtle tones and contours of a face could be captured, to get that 3-D effect.\n\n> Opacity of the overlaying photo could be adjusted to allow close comparison between your drawing and the photo.\n\n> The overlaying photo responds to on-screen gesture: you could move, scale and rotate the photo during sketching.\n\n> A zoom option allows you to zoom in on your drawing for delicate pencil work.\n\nin addition :\n\n> A Vermeer’s Lens channel is also created on youtube to provide our users with additional \"instructions & tutorials\"on the use of this app to create art (videos updated regularly).\n\nThis is linked directly to the app via the  “Demo” button.\n\n> You can email us for support/feedback directly via the “Contact Us” button on the main menu of the app. Or leave a message (go to the “about” tab) on our youtube channel    (see “Developer’s website” below).\n\nFor more info and demo:\n\n> See “Developer’s website” below",

    "description": "Here is the long-awaited successor to our critically acclaimed flight simulator for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. It simulates the Space Shuttle approach and landing in incredible detail and accuracy.\n\n\nThis is a completely new version, rewritten from scratch. Our custom rendering engine delivers desktop class flight simulation to mobile devices: a unique combination of realistic flight dynamics, stunning graphics, and fun game play.\n\n\nYou’ve never landed a Space Shuttle before? We’ve got you covered: Included are several tutorials with varying degrees of autopilot assist. Our landing analysis and scoring system tells you exactly how to improve your next landing. It will make you come back and try again.\n\nEach flight starts at either 10,000 feet, already aligned with the runway, or at up to 50,000 feet, before banking into the heading alignment cone. During descent, the Orbiter is an unpowered glider, so you will only have one chance to get it right. Astronauts used to call it a flying brick: because of its 200,000 lbs. gross weight and low lift over drag ratio, the approach is six times steeper and two times faster than a typical airliner approach. After your first safe touchdown, chase that perfect landing, compare your high scores online with your friends, earn medals, and unlock achievements. Experiment with different wind conditions, night approaches, and even emergency scenarios or system failures. At the end of each flight, watch a replay from different camera angles.\n\nYou control the Orbiter’s pitch and roll axes by tilting your device. Alternatively, you may switch to on-screen analog sticks or use a gamepad. Rudder, speed brake, gear, and chute are usually handled by the autopilot, but you can have full manual control if you like. For beginners, we’ve added rectangles that visualize the desired approach path. Simply try to stay within the corridor of rectangles, and they’ll guide you right to the touchdown point. Advanced pilots can turn them off and rely on the instruments in the head-up display (HUD) instead. The simulated guidance, navigation and control (GNC) systems are authentic replications of their counterparts in the real Orbiter, and the HUD features all the instruments real Space Shuttle commanders used to employ to skillfully land this unique aircraft. Now it’s your turn to give it a try.\n\nA new orbit mode lets you take the Orbiter for a spin around the planet, and we’re working on a full atmospheric re-entry scenario, which, among other new features, will be released as free updates in the coming months.\n\nThere are no ads or in app purchases, and we don’t collect any personal data.",

    "description": "Hydraulic Cylinder Calculator is a tool for working with Hydraulic Cylinders. Based on the inputs the user can calculate areas & volumes in the cylinder, ratio, extraction & retraction forces, time, velocity and outflow.\n\nFeatures:\n- By Input the require parameters like the Piston diameter, pressure and oil flow, the result are calculate on the fly including areas, volumes for the cylinder, ratio, extraction & retraction forces, velocity, time and outflow.\n- Results are derived on both the Piston and Rod side of the Hydraulic Cylinder.\n- Results are calculate on the fly.\n- Interactive 3D images depicting the parameters provide the user with a good understanding of the Hydraulic Cylinder system.\n- Support for both Metric and Imperial units.\n- Results are copy-able to clipboard.\n\nA hydraulic cylinder (also called a linear hydraulic motor) is a mechanical actuator that is used to give a unidirectional force through a unidirectional stroke. It has many applications, notably in construction equipment (engineering vehicles), manufacturing machinery, and civil engineering.\n\nHydraulic cylinders get their power from pressurized hydraulic fluid, which is typically oil. The hydraulic cylinder consists of a cylinder barrel, in which a piston connected to a piston rod moves back and forth. The barrel is closed on one end by the cylinder bottom (also called the cap) and the other end by the cylinder head (also called the gland) where the piston rod comes out of the cylinder. The piston has sliding rings and seals. The piston divides the inside of the cylinder into two chambers, the bottom chamber (cap end) and the piston rod side chamber (rod end / head end).\n\nFlanges, trunnions, clevises, and lugs are common cylinder mounting options. The piston rod also has mounting attachments to connect the cylinder to the object or machine component that it is pushing or pulling.\n\nA hydraulic cylinder is the actuator or \"motor\" side of this system. The \"generator\" side of the hydraulic system is the hydraulic pump which delivers a fixed or regulated flow of oil to the hydraulic cylinder, to move the piston. The piston pushes the oil in the other chamber back to the reservoir. If we assume that the oil enters from cap end, during extension stroke, and the oil pressure in the rod end / head end is approximately zero, the force F on the piston rod equals the pressure P in the cylinder times the piston area A.\n\nThanks for your support and do visit nitrio.com for more apps for your iOS devices.",

Now, eminent philosopher Simon Blackburn offers the most authoritative and up-to-date dictionary of philosophy available in a single volume. Ranging from Aristotle to Zen, the two thousand plus entries cover the entire span of philosophy, from the Vedas (written over three thousand years ago) to the most recent technical terminology, with ample coverage of important themes from Chinese, Indian, Islamic, and Jewish philosophy. Here are all the terms one would expect to find in a comprehensive dictionary of philosophy--idealism and empiricism, ethics and aesthetics, Epicureanism and Stoicism, existentialism and logical positivism, and much more. Blackburn also defines many concepts not normally found in such reference works, including entries for apathy, laughter, and the meaning of life, and he includes relevant terms from disciplines such as mathematics, physics, biology, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. In addition, there are capsule biographies of nearly five hundred individuals, from the pre-Socratics to such contemporary figures as Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, Richard Rorty, and Simone de Beauvoir.\n\n▸ Basic features include: \n- Easy navigation\n- Bookmark a word\n- Words of the day\n- Learn random words\n- Flashcard\n\n▸ If you want to suggest a new function or report an issue, please send feedback to us.

    "description": "Lovecraft’s Untold Stories is an action rogue-lite with RPG elements. You explore randomly generated levels based on the H.P. Lovecraft stories, fighting cultists and all kinds of monsters from the Mythos, improving your weapons and gear, solving puzzles and challenges, and looking for clues and knowledge to defeat the Great Old Ones and the Outer Gods.\n\nLIVE H.P. LOVECRAFT’S STORIES\n\nLovecraft’s Untold Stories is based on H.P. Lovecraft’s stories. You will experience first-hand the cosmic horror created by the genius of Providence. Every character will go through an investigation that will take them through different locations, from the creepy old Victorian mansion to the abandoned hospital where forbidden experiments take place or the jungle where lost tribes celebrate forgotten rituals, just to name a few. Levels are randomly generated: it will be a different experience every time you play. Also, they vary depending on the character you’re playing with. Look for items and clues to unlock secrets and new stories.\n\n5 CHARACTERS, 5 WAYS OF FIGHTING THE MYTHOS\n\nYou can play as 5 different characters, each with a different playstyle and storyline. A private detective, a witch, a thief, a professor, and even a ghoul—each with different stats, weapons, and combat moves, creating five entirely different gameplay experiences. The Detective offers a balanced playstyle, with average Health and Stamina. The Professor is a specialist in ranged combat, with less Health and a special shield granted by his weapon, the Tillinghast. The Witch does a lot of damage, has teleport abilities and elemental shields of fire and ice, but also a very low Health. The Thief is a specialist in melée combat that takes advantage of its stealth to maximize her damage. The ghoul does a lot of melée damage, has a high Health and regenerates itself, but can’t use medkits at all.\n\nKEY FEATURES\n* Fight hundreds of different monsters from the Cthulhu Mythos in this intense action roguelite \nExplore Lovecraft’s stories: every character has a storyline that crosses randomly generated levels set in different locations from Lovecraft’s stories, such as the hospital, the jungle, or the port city just to name a few\n\n* Face the Great Old Ones: Great Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Dagon, Shub-Niggurath, and Azathoth await you in special levels\n\n* Investigate thoroughly: explore every corner to find secret levels and knowledge about the Great Old Ones\n\n* Learn about the Mythos to fight them: to have a chance at fighting the Great Old Ones you need to acquire knowledge about them or their mere presence will drive you insane\n\n* Madness awaits: in the course of your adventures you will have to make some decisions, and taking the wrong ones will shake your sanity. If it gets too low, you will start losing your mind – and if you go mad you will take your own life to escape the horror \n\n* Pick your hero: Choose between 5 different characters, the detective, the thief, the professor, the witch, and the ghoul\n\n* Different playstyles: every investigator has a different combat style and skills, but levels also vary depending on who you’re playing them with – so the gameplay experience is totally different\n\n* Collect and improve weapons, items, and artefacts. Each character has a set of weapons and items, and there are hundreds of other items you can find and use!\n\n* Look for clues and special items to unlock secrets and new stories",

Whether you've built up your collection for decades or just got sent an album full of b-sides of your favorite artist, you need a place to carry your own music.\n\nLet Doppi be that place. Doppi (pronounced doh-pie) raises the bar in iOS app design in an essentially simple music player, built just for your local music files.\n\nEnjoy your music with: \n\n• A beautifully simple interface\n• Fluid gesture-based navigation\n• Always-reachable search and playback controls\n\nSupports MP3, M4A, FLAC, and more. Browse and play music:\n\n• Received via AirDrop\n• Copied from the Files app\n• Shared from other apps (selecting \"Copy to Doppi\")\n• Added to the Doppi folder in Files or via iTunes File Sharing\n• Synced from iTunes\n• Downloaded from Cloud Music Library\n\n————\nImportant: \nDoppi does not support Apple Music offline downloads outside of Cloud Music Library.\n————\n\nWith Doppi:\n\nBig, Beautiful Artwork\nYour music's artwork takes center stage on the Now Playing screen and throughout your library.\n\nMake It Your Own\nChoose from 6 highlight colors and 32 beautiful icons, switch between 4 light and dark themes, rearrange your library tabs, and more—all from Preferences.\n\nSearch From Anywhere\nPull down from anywhere in your library to invoke Search. Hit Return to instantly trigger the top result.\n\nPlay and Add Quickly\nPlay an album or artist right from the library using their embedded Play buttons, and add songs to Up Next using the Add (+) buttons.\n\nMark Your Likes\nTap the heart on the player (or choose Like from a menu) to Like tracks. Liked music appears in the Liked Songs playlist, Liked Albums on Search, and is more likely to play in Shuffle All.\n\nMake Playlists\nCreate all-new playlists, duplicate them, or copy them from Apple Music. Tap and hold on anything to add those songs to a list.\n\nAdd Lyrics\nSearch for lyrics on the web right from the app and add them to your songs. Enjoy them on Doppi's beautiful player interface.\n\nManage Your Music\nEverything in your library has useful actions — just tap and hold to reveal a menu. For example, if you're not feeling some of your music, you can exclude it from Shuffle All, hide it from your library, or delete it (if it's from imported files).\n\nLess, But Better\nEvery screen in Doppi has been carefully designed with clean typography, pleasing contrast, and elegant motion. Enjoy your music without unnecessary distractions.\n\nEasily Readable\nDoppi fully supports Dynamic Type and includes high contrast themes, so your eyes won't get in the way of your ears.\n\nContinue Album\nEver shuffled your music, found a song you loved, and wished you could keep playing the album without stopping the song? Doppi can make it happen — just navigate to the album and press Play.\n\nGive your music the lovely home it deserves.\n\n————\nImportant:\nDoppi does not include any music. It was designed to play the music files that you own and that you transfer manually to your device. It does not support music from any streaming service.",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

    "description": "*** AeroWeather: for pilots, aviation enthusiasts, and everyone who is serious about the weather!\n*** Current and precise weather conditions (METAR) and forecasts (TAF).\n\nAeroWeather Pro provides quick and intuitive access to METAR and TAF for airports worldwide. Data can be shown in its original (raw) format or as fully decoded and easy understandable texts. AeroWeather Pro is helpful for weather preflight-briefings, but also to just get very precise weather. All weather data is cached for offline access. \n\nIn addition to weather data, AeroWeather Pro integrates also airport NOTAMs (provided by US FAA), webcam images around airports (provided by windy.com), FlightService access (US only), and US ATC delay information (provided by US FAA). AeroWeather Pro also offers built-in groups for earthquakes, nearby stations, and today widget, which can be individually enabled on the top level view. Besides creating user groups it’s also possible to put stations on the same level user groups (e.g. home base). Depending on your needs, groups can be shown or hidden in the main list view. User groups can also be synchronized via Cloud Kit*. \n\nThe app features a built-in airport database, which includes airport data like runways, sunrise/sunset, twilight times, moon times, timezones etc. \n\nMETAR alert notifications** is another new and helpful feature to stay up-to-date. Define multiple alerts for each station with criteria like: flight rule (US NOAA), wind speed, temperature, pressure, present weather, visibility etc. Notifications will be sent to your device if the criteria is met (e.g., when flight rule becomes IFR).\n\nDedicated METAR/TAF** access is optionally available. METAR/TAF data will come primarily from a certified ANSP (air navigation service provider) and is provided reliably and fast from our dedicated, redundant servers (indicated by blue checkmark underneath METAR/TAF).\n\nThe AeroPix feature offers users the possibility to take quickly picture(s) of the weather at their current location. \n\nAeroWeather Pro comes with an Apple Watch app, which shows either a list of stations as defined in the Apple Watch group or all nearby stations based on the current location. METAR and TAF are displayed for each station. In addition, you can put AeroWeather as a complication in your watch face to stay up-to-date. \n\nAn iMessage app is also included which lets you easily send METAR/TAF of any airport to other users.\n\nPlease consult our web-site for a full description of all features. \n\n* Additional functionality which needs to be unlocked (one-time purchase). These purchases are not transferable between Lite, Pro, and Mac.\n\n** SUBSCRIPTIONS\nAdditional features which generate recurring operation costs for us will be offered within a subscription. The following features are enabled while 'First' subscription is active:\n - Dedicated METAR/TAF data source\n - Meteograms\n - Alert push notifications\n - D-ATIS (bigger US airports only)\n - Area Forecast Discussions (currently US only)\n - Home Screen Widgets for METAR, Plot, Meteogram (iOS 14 or higher)\n - Imagery and Charts (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n - SIGMETs (requires 'Captain' subscription)\n\nAdditional features are also enabled when using AeroWeather Lite.\n\nThe subscription varies in time periods (1 month, 12 months). The subscription is valid in both AeroWeather Lite and Pro. Cross app subscription support is only available if iCloud (with the same Apple ID) is enabled. Previously purchased unlock features are not affected and will work with or without subscription.\n\nAuto-renewal may be turned off at any time by going to your account settings. A payment will be charged to your iTunes account at the end of the free trial period. Your iTunes account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. No commitment - you can cancel any time.\n\nPleas read the full “Subscription Terms of Use” at:\nhttps://www.lakehorn.com/subscription-terms-of-use/",

Watermarking is increasingly important and is like signing your name to an image. A watermark subtly displays, no matter where your photo goes, that it's yours. Watermarking can also be used to add your email, url, a personal message or fun graphics to any photo or Pokemon Go screenshot.\n\n\"It's by far the best watermarking App I've seen to date on iOS.\"\n- Terry White, review on bestappsite.com\n\nVideo Review by the Daily App Show:\nhttp://dailyappshow.com/iwatermark\n\nThanks to all iWatermark users for the great reviews, feedback and suggestions. \n\niWatermark, is the only watermarking tool available for all 4 platforms iPhone/iPad, Mac and Windows. iWatermark is the most popular professional watermarking tool for photos.\n\nSocial media sharing at full resolution to Facebook, Flickr, Instagram, Twitter, Camera Album, Clipboard or Email (3 resolution options).\n\nFeatures\n\n  * Touch gestures.\n     ** Click to move the watermark location.\n     ** Pinch/zoom to expand/contract the size of the watermark. \n     ** Two fingers at once to rotate the watermark to any angle.\n  * Batch processing (all at once) or sequential.\n  * Easily adjust the watermarks scale, opacity, font, color, size, position and angle.\n  * Create your own subtle text or graphic watermarks or select from the included example watermarks (both text and graphics).\n  * Included examples are both text (names, dates, tag data, etc.) and graphic (signatures, logos, etc.) watermarks which can be used immediately. \n  * 162 fonts for your text watermarks 112 + 50 iOS fonts.\n  * Displays each font.\n  * 34 high-res watermarks.\n  * Import your own graphic watermarks by sending yourself an email with attached graphic.\n  * One button import of your signature for use as a watermark.\n  * Complete and easy to understand manual.\n  * Create a QR watermark which is like a barcode. QR codes can contain up to 4000 chars of information. QR codes can then be read with a scanner or smartphone with the right app revealing the info you encoded. \n\nWhy Watermark?\n\nDigitally sign your photos/artwork with iWatermark to claim, secure and maintain your intellectual property and reputation.\n\n- Photos go viral then they fly off globally. Watermark with name, email or url so your photo has a visible and legal connection to you.\n- Build your company brand, by having your company logo on all your images.\n- Promote your company, name and website by using QR codes as watermarks.\n- Avoid the surprise of seeing your photos and/or artwork elsewhere on the web or in an ad.\n- Avoid the conflicts, costly litigation and headaches from plagiarists who claim they didn't know that you created it.\n- Avoid intellectual property (IP) squabbles.\n\nQ:I want to stamp my signature as my watermark. How do I add my graphic signature like the examples, Picasso, Ben Franklin, etc.? \nA:Use our signature tool or make the .png graphics on your computer, email it to yourself, open the email on your iOS device and save to your photo album. In iWatermark create a graphic watermark and choose the graphic from your photo album to add it as a new watermark.\n\nQ:Will it work with Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus?\nA:Yes\n\nSee the manual for more details:\nhttp://www.plumamazing.com/iphone/iwatermark-iphone/iwatermarkhelp/\n\nIMPORTANT: The signatures of John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Galileo are just examples of graphic watermarks. They are the real signatures of these historic people. They are there as examples to show what is possible. We recommend you create your own signature, logo or QR code watermarks.\n\nContact us if you need help or have a suggestion.",

    "description": "GeoShred Pro Version 5, is an exciting update, now with In-App-Purchases for GeoSWAM instruments on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater.  \n\nImagine a new kind of musical instrument ... \n\nAn instrument where a performer can fluidly express multiple independent voices.  An instrument that is both pitch fluid, and helps the performer precisely reach desired musical pitches in any temperament.  \n\nGeoShred is an award-winning,  fluidly expressive musical instrument that runs on multi-touch devices. \n\nIt has a performance surface with “almost magic” pitch rounding algorithms which is coupled with a model of the physics of several types of musical instruments, support for AUv3, MIDI In/Out, MPE, and 3D Touch.  It’s a fusion of Jordan Rudess’ performance concepts and a powerful, modeled guitar/effects based on the Physical Modeling research of Dr. Julius O. Smith III of Stanford/CCRMA.  And, GeoShred's expressive control can be used with other synthesizers.\n\nTens of thousands of artists in 48 countries perform GeoShred with 30% of those users in India. \n\nGeoShred is the Gold Medal Winner of the 2019 Denny Award, winner of a 2019 Guthman New Musical Instrument Award, and winner of the 2017 Electronic Musician Editor's Choice Award as \"one of the most innovative, groundbreaking products to emerge in the past twelve months\".\n\n\nGeoShred Pro Version 5 Features include:\n\n• In-App-Purchases (IAP) for 6 different GeoSWAM instruments, GeoViolin, GeoFlute, GeoTenoSax, GeoCello, GeoClarinet, and GeoOboe \n• A fluidly expressive playing surface + a Physically modeled guitar\n• Au3 plugin support on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater \n• Intelligent pitch rounding\n• A diatonic keyboard where every key on the screen is in the scale.\n• MIDI IN/OUT and MPE support\n• MIDI control using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, virtual MIDI and all digital interfaces \n• MIDI configuration presets\n• 3D touch on iPhones that support 3D touch\n• Customizable control surface can be mapped to physical MIDI controls\n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus support.\n• Backing tracks\n• Multiple Modeled effects\n• Modeled feedback and VCF effects\n• Echo, a unique looper and multi-tap echo \n• Finger vibrato, slide and fret scraping\n• Unique mono mode using intervals of multiple strings. \n• Built-in Arpeggiator\n• Alternative tunings and temperaments\n• Support for world scales and temperaments including Indian Ragas, Arabic and Balinese scales. \n• Easily share presets with friends\n\n---\n \nPraise for the GeoShred family of apps: \n\n“GeoShred is brilliant- it’s a real instrument.” – Eddie Jobson\n\n“A fantastic new invention which is going to revolutionize the way music is played, expressed and learned! “GeoShred” is one of the foremost best musical inventions I’ve had the pleasure to experience in recent years. Definitely 5 stars out of 5! GIGANTASTIVISSIMO…..R…A…Z !!!!!” – Patrick Moraz\n\n“That’s just nuts. You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.  It would mean a lot to us if you could leave your positive review on the App Store and If you have any questions about GeoShred we would love to hear from you at our support email address: support@moforte.com \n\n---\n\nMinimum Requirements:  iOS 11.4 or better is required for AUv3, iCloud and GeoSWAM instruments.\n***Note: The GeoSWAM instruments can ONLY be performed from the GeoShred keyboard or MPE controllers.\n***Note: Unfortunately, due to App Store limitations, previously purchased instrument IAPs can not be applied to a purchase of the collection IAP.",
