It's extremely simple.\n\nIf you DON'T wear your Watch to bed, then simply take your Watch off before you go to sleep. As soon as you touch your iPhone or put your Watch back on in the morning then AutoSleep will know that you have finished sleeping. \n\nAs everyone is a little bit different. AutoSleep provides a simple setup wizard and an option to tweak if you are a very restless sleeper. \n\nIf you wear your Apple Watch to bed*, AutoSleep will also analyse your sleep quality. By using time asleep, restlessness, time awake and heart rate it can score the quality of your sleep and provide you with a comprehensive nightly analysis. \n*Note. If you do not wear your Watch to bed, AutoSleep simply captures the amount of time sleeping. \n\nAutoSleep also works with HeartWatch our premier heart & activity monitoring app and writes your Sleep information to Apple Health. \n\n*Requires Apple Watch running Watch OS 4 or higher.

All this, in a package that fits in your pocket.\n \nSlow Shutter Cam offers three capture modes to capture unique images:\n \nMOTION BLUR: Equivalent to the shutter priority mode on a DSLR, the Motion Blur mode is perfect for creating ghost images, waterfall effects or suggesting movement in your photographs by adding a blur.\n\nLIGHT TRAIL: The Light Trail mode allows you to 'paint' with light, show car light trails and fireworks or capture any other moving light in a unique way. Unlike shooting with a DSLR and being tied to specific rigid settings to obtain good results, the Light Trail mode takes care of the essentials, letting your creativity soar!\n\nLOW LIGHT: In low light conditions, this capture mode allows the camera to accumulate every photon of light hitting the sensor. The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

Rekt silently, and safely, removes all of them. \n\nRekt also automatically redirects AMP links to their correct source website. \n\n\nPRIVACY FIRST\n---------------\nRekt has been built with a privacy first approach. \n\n- All the blocking happens on your device with literally ZERO data being recorded or sent back to be data mined. \n- Rekt doesn't keep usage data like the count of how many popups and banners it has blocked or links it has redirected. \n- Rekt doesn't even come with basic app analytics or telemetry to keep track of how many times you've opened or use the app. \n- It does check whether you have dark mode on or not so it can show you the correct tutorial video. (I hate opening a bright video on dark mode as much as you.)\n\nIf you're a security researcher, feel free to reach out to me for a license to make sure the app isn't up to anything funky.\n\n\nDECLUTTER THE \"MODERN\" WEB\n----------------------------------\nCurrently, it de-clutters and removes most “omfg please use our app” banners and buttons as well as the annoying login popups from:\n\n- Reddit\n- Twitter\n- Facebook\n- Quora\n- Instagram\n- Imgur\n\nAs added bonuses;\n- Rekt nukes those infernal AMP links from Google by transparently redirecting you to the correct, canonical link.\n- Prevent Quora from asking you to login to just look at an answer. \n\nWhether it’s Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Imgur, Quora, or Reddit, everyone wants me, and by extension you, to use their damned apps to consume content. \n\nHarder for us to block ads and much easier for them to scoop up your data, right? To further that agenda, simply browsing their sites on Safari now means we’re inundated with, well, waves of crap.\n\nWhether it’s a modal covering half the screen with links to the App Store, an immediate popup asking you to login, or a header screaming “the app is 10x better”; it has to go. All of it.",

    "description": "***** “What does it do? Everything… quickly and easily. It’s really awesome!“ – Life In LoFi\n\n***** \"Handy Photo is an absolute must buy that delivers an amazing photo editing package...\" – AppleNApps\n\n***** “For the features and performance delivered, the app is a must have for all iOS device users who enjoying photo editing.” – ePHOTOzine\n\n\nWelcome to creative photo editing!\n\nHandy Photo was designed for those with a strong passion for photo editing. The app is a perfect choice when it comes to correcting and enhancing photos from all possible angles.\n\n* Making tonal and color adjustments globally and locally *\nImprove the general look of your photos by performing both global and local tonal and color corrections in them. With a few taps and swipes only, turn your images into vivid and vibrant works of art.\n\n* Retouching photos with ultimate ease *\nRemove unwanted content from your photos in a tap. Mobile image retouching has never been so fast and easy. \n\n* Moving objects from photo to photo *\nIs it possible to move any object within a single photo or to another image in just a few taps? The answer is yes when it comes to the Move Me tool. With it, you can do the impossible – move objects in photos to the locations they would never move to in real life.\n\n* Applying filters to images partially *\nWith the Handy Photo’s powerful photo filters, which include Black and White, Bleach Bypass, Color Standout, Cross Process, Dramatic, Duotone, Fog, Glow, Golden, HDR, Halftone, Ink, Lomo, Old Photo, Polarization, Polaroid, Sepia, Sketch, Smart Contrast, Tilt-Shift, Tiny Planet, Vignette, and Vintage, you can add whatever artistic effects wanted to your images. The filters are all adjustable and, thanks to the partial application feature, can be easily combined within photos. \n\n* Adding textures to photos partially *\nApply the Handy Photo’s terrific textures to your images to make them truly pop. You can select from the following categories of textures: Abstract, Cloth, Clouds, Frost and Ice, Grunge, Paper, Water, and Wood. All the textures can be adjusted to taste and applied to photos partially. \n\n* Uncropping photos in a unique way *\nThe tool is called Magic not accidentally. It allows uniquely uncropping photos. No other app can do that.

    "description": "Ultra Wide Angle 8mm Camera for iPhone and iPad, high level of accuracy and quality. \n\nThe Ultra Wide Angle 8mm Camera app combines several frames into one continuous image. For example, you can take 3-20 overlapping frames of a city skyline, and then merge them into a ultra wide angle panorama. This app can assemble photos that are tiled horizontally as well as vertically, and multi rows photos supported. \n    \n\nINTERIORS & ENCLOSED SPACES\nYou can take Ultra wide angle pictures in fairly confined spaces. A wide angle lens can be an absolute requirement in enclosed spaces, simply because one cannot move far enough away from their subject to get all of them in the photo (using a normal lens). A common example is photography of interior rooms or other indoor architecture. This kind of photography is also perhaps the easiest way to make the most of a wide angle lens — in part because it forces you to be close to the subject.\n\nAnd if you want to be able to get cool architectural features or interesting shots, then on vacation or anywhere, run Ultra Wide Angle 8mm Camera app.\n\nOVERLAP 30%\nIn order for the Ultra Wide Angle 8mm Camera app to do all that clever merging, blending and stitching it needs a reference point to work out what goes where. Or more importantly, a big enough reference point. In experience 30% overlap is perfect. With 30% overlap you should be able to capture a scene in 5-16 successive shots.\n\n\n\nNote: \n\n1. Choose a reference point about 20-30% away from the right edge of the viewfinder \n2. Swivel the camera to the right until your reference point is at the left edge of the viewfinder \n3. Take the picture \n4. Repeat until you have taken photos that cover the entire area you wish to capture in your panorama \n\nOverlap the images – the images should overlap by at least 30%. Outside of this range, Photomerge may not be able to align the files correctly. \nShoot vertical – this is a little counter-intuitive since we’re making panoramas. It’s usually best to shoot vertical (portrait orientation). Since you’ll merge multiple frames together later to get as wide as you need, shooting vertical will give you a taller overall panorama. Also, you’ll need some of this vertical space for cropping. More on cropping later. \n\nUpload to Social Network \nWith iOS, you can connect directly to your social network accounts, allowing you to post and share content from nearly anywhere. iOS provides integrated support for: \n▪Twitter \n▪Facebook \n▪Flickr \n▪Vimeo \n▪Sina Weibo \n▪Tencent Weibo \n▪Blush and Mascara \n\nYou can add your account in Settings, after adding your account, you can configure additional settings or download the official iOS app for that service.",

Simply ask somebody to choose a card from a deck, or ask them to *tell you any card that pops in their mind*. Amazingly, their card is the one being held up in an photograph from the 1800's!\n\nFrom the creator of Marty's Magic Coin (over 30k sold worldwide) comes \"Psypic\", a new mentalism trick easy enough for beginners, but versatile enough for advanced magicians.  Requires no props (except your iPhone/iPod).  Can be performed anytime, anywhere!\n\nIllusion\n\nThe performer lays an iPhone down on a table with an 1800's era family photograph displayed.  A spectator chooses or thinks of any card or announces the first animal that comes to mind.  The performer scrolls to the face of his great-great-grandfather Jack, zooms out, and amazingly, Jack is holding the card/animal that the spectator chose.\n\nSimplicity\n\nThis app comes with a detailed video demonstration and discussion as well as text instructions.  No sleight of hand is required! After only a few minutes of practice, you'll be fooling everybody.\n\nThis can be performed anywhere, anytime.  You can use a deck of cards for show, if you like, but you absolutely do not need them.\n\nImagine being in bar and telling somebody you'll perform an amazing trick for them.  You will use them to communicate with your dead ancestor.  Have them sit quiet for a moment and announce or write down the first animal that comes to mind.  Scroll the iPhone over to the picture of your ancestor who will be holding a drawing of that animal.\n\nNote: This app does not use the camera or microphone to work, so your spectator can tell you a card, draw a card on paper, draw a card in the air with their finger, point to a card, or any other technique you want!",

It gives us the features of a DSLR but in a fast, easy to use camera app.\n\nFor Filmmakers - the features you need, not the ones you don’t. Color profiles, bitrates, dual-channel audio meters, real-time waveforms, and fast access to frame rates.\n\nFor Photographers - easier than shooting on your DSLR. Shoot in RAW (even in BURST), split focus / exposure, and manually control everything (exposure, iso, shutter speed, white balance and focus).\n\nFor Everyone Else - inspired by the pro’s we made the interface simple, fast, and easy to use. We provide getting started tips, video tutorials, and full time customer service to get you setup.\n\nWe love hearing from you. If you have any features, ideas, or feedback please email us at hello@shopmoment.com or DM us on Instagram @moment.\n\n## Premium Features\n+ NEW Timelapse mode - capture stunning time-lapse videos.\n+ Slow Shutter mode - long exposure shots with motion blur and light trails.\n\n## Photography Features\n+ Focus peaking - the green edges will help you dial in your focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ RAW and TIFF - Shoot photos in RAW format for better editing, or TIFF for high-quality printing.\n+ Split Focus and Exposure - Take control of tricky lighting scenarios.\n+ Full Manual - Control shutter speed, iso, exposure, focus, and white balance with easy to use sliders and double taps to reset.\n+ Burst mode - Capture burst shots in RAW format. This is big as now you can capture action with burst but at the uncompressed quality pros want with RAW.\n+ HEIF and HEVC - Seamless support for the latest Apple file formats across photos and videos.\n\n## Filmmaker Features\n+ Focus peaking - the yellow edge glow will help you find dial in the focus.\n+ Zebra stripes - We overlay stripes onto the over and underexposed areas in the viewfinder.\n+ Color Profiles - Select from default, flat, or log color profiles to get the most out of your files in post-processing.\n+ Video Bitrates - Get precise control over video quality with standard, medium, and high bitrates to choose from.\n+ RGB Histogram: Dial in your video color, balance, and exposure with a live RGB histogram.\n+ Waveform monitor - Evaluate video brightness and exposure across your image in real time.\n+ Audio meters - Get just the right sound levels with real-time, precise, dual-channel (when available) audio levels.\n+ Live Histogram - Get your exposure right every time.\n+ Video Stabilization - Make your videos buttery smooth.\n+ Precise Video - Change your resolution and frame rate on screen, without digging into a settings menu.\n+ Anamorphic - Use the Moment Anamorphic lens to shoot amazing, letterbox style photos and videos.\n\n## Works With\n+ Triple/Dual Lens Control - Manually control which side of the triple/dual lens you want to shoot with so you can use Moment lenses over either one.\n+ Moment Lens - select which lens you are shooting with.\n+ Moment Battery Case - Works with the DSLR-like shutter button on our photography cases for half-press and full-press capture.
