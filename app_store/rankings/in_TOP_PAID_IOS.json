    "description": "Application to mirror the screen of your iPhone or iPad to any Samsung Smart TV. No wires and no additional hardware needed! You can mirror any app on your iPhone or iPad to your Samsung TV.\n\nTo mirror video as well as audio, please make sure that you start mirroring when you are in the app (Photos, YouTube, Facebook etc.) that you want to mirror to your TV.\n\nThis works on any Samsung Smart TV from the 2012 models onward. Which model year do you have? You can see that by looking at the middle letter in your model type (on the back of your Samsung TV).\n\nE = 2012\nF = 2013\nH = 2014\nJ = 2015\nK = 2016\nM = 2017\nN = 2018\nR = 2019\nT = 2020\nQ = QLED (also supported)\n\nFor instance:\n\nUE55_E_S8000 = 2012.\nUE78_H_U8500L = 2014.\n\nIn using the app, there will be a couple of seconds of latency (usually between 1 and 3). So this mirroring is not suitable for gaming. \n\nHowever, it is very suitable for watching movies, giving presentations, watching photos, and much more!\n\nHow the app works:\n\n1. Make sure that your iPhone or iPad is connected to the same local network as your Samsung TV. Don't use multiple VLANs or subnets.\n\n2. Launch the Mirror for Samsung TV app. It will start looking for your Samsung TV(s) on your local network. When a TV is found, please select it. When you use this app for the first time, depending on your model Samsung TV, the TV might ask you to \"allow\" the connection. In that case, take your TV Remote Control and press OK to allow the connection from your TV to your iPhone or iPad.\n\n3. Turn on notifications for this app. We will not spam you, but we will use this to let you know if your TV is working correctly or not. So please, please allow it, otherwise when things don't work as they should, you are left in the dark.\n\n4. Click on Start Mirroring to start mirroring on the TV that is currently selected. After that, you can just go to any other app on your iPhone or iPad and the mirroring just continues to run.\n\n5. To stop mirroring, there are two options. (1) click on the red top bar that you will see on your iPhone or iPad. (2) Go to the Mirror for Samsung TV app and click on Stop Mirroring.\n\nLimitations and known issues:\n\nDRM\n\nSome apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney and AppleTV+ have decided to block this.\n\nThere is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:\n\nOpen that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.\n\nAbout Screen Recording and Privacy\n\nEven though there are notifications about Screen Recording, we don't record your screen into files and we don't send any content to a server. We only temporarily store data in memory, before it is streamed to TV. Upon streaming, the content is removed from memory.\n\nSupport:\nIf you have questions or would like to provide feedback, please send us an e-mail or chat with us on our Facebook page.\n\nWhat our users are saying:\n\n\"Amazing\" - 5 STARS - by Pmanswah\nAt first I thought it was going to trash then saw the reviews and thought they were bots.I bought the app and used it and it worked perfectly perfect sound and audio this app is a match made in heaven for me.\n\n\"It Works!\" - 5 STARS - by cutters60\nAt first had trouble setting it up, but after following the video guide to set it up, “Bingo” it works a treat. Also their support is brilliant, they responded in less than an hour of the query I emailed to them.\n\nPlease give us feedback by mailing to support@airbeam.tv",

QR codes can then be read with a scanner or smartphone with the right app revealing the info you encoded. \n\nWhy Watermark?\n\nDigitally sign your photos/artwork with iWatermark to claim, secure and maintain your intellectual property and reputation.\n\n- Photos go viral then they fly off globally.

How do I add my graphic signature like the examples, Picasso, Ben Franklin, etc.? \nA:Use our signature tool or make the .png graphics on your computer, email it to yourself, open the email on your iOS device and save to your photo album. In iWatermark create a graphic watermark and choose the graphic from your photo album to add it as a new watermark.\n\nQ:Will it work with Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fuji, Olympus?\nA:Yes\n\nSee the manual for more details:\nhttp://www.plumamazing.com/iphone/iwatermark-iphone/iwatermarkhelp/\n\nIMPORTANT: The signatures of John Hancock, Ben Franklin, Galileo are just examples of graphic watermarks. They are the real signatures of these historic people. They are there as examples to show what is possible. We recommend you create your own signature, logo or QR code watermarks.\n\nContact us if you need help or have a suggestion.",

    "description": "The oral tradition of Vedic chanting is one of India's greatest cultural legacies. Although Vedic chanting was originally the purview of teachers who were responsible for its preservation and transmission, with the gradual shift away from traditional systems of work and lifestyle, it became apparent that unless stringent measures were taken to preserve the art of Vedic chanting, the valuable teachings of the Veda-s would be lost. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that T Krishnamacharya (1888 - 1989), the legendary yoga master and scholar pioneered the removal of the restrictions on the transmission of the Veda-s, throwing open the doors of Vedic chanting to anyone who respects the tradition and wishes to play an active role in its preservation for posterity. This audio App, conceived as a learning aid to help students who wish to understand the nuances of Vedic chanting, crystallizes the essence of T Krishnamacharya's approach.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAcross India, there are several traditions of Vedic chanting and hence, corresponding pedagogical variations, depending on the particular branch of the Veda-s followed by teachers of different lineages. In this audio guide to Vedic chanting, the teaching tradition of T Krishnamacharya, as passed on by TKV Desikachar, Founder, Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram, is represented.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis product presents a detailed overview of the key rules of Vedic chanting with appropriate examples and also guides the listener in the integration of these tools in the process of Vedic chanting using a selection of simple and more complex chants from the Yajur Veda. This App follows the traditional adhyayanam format of recitation and repetition where the listener has the opportunity to listen, learn and then chant.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIt must be emphasized here that this product is not intended to replace the one-on-one transmission of teachings which is the crux of the Vedic tradition, but rather to complement this process and give students a means for self-study and revision even at their own places of residence, where they may not have easy access to a teacher.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nConcept: Dr. Latha Satish, Managing Trustee, Krishnamacharya Yoga Mandiram \r\n\r\nPresentation: Radha Sundararajan, Nrithya Jagannathan",

    "description": "The concept of the mental focus grid has been in existence for many years - as a tool/exercise used by coaches and sports performance/psychology professionals to assess and improve performance of their athletes.  \n\nThe objective of the concentration grid exercise is to select in sequence each of the numbers (randomly arranged and presented) in the grid.  Performance is timed.  The challenge is to complete the grid as quickly as possible.  The exercise calls for focus and concentration. \n\nThe concentration grid exercise has been a long-time favorite of many baseball/softball coaches and players (typically using printed/paper sheets, a pen and a stopwatch).  \n\nCoaches/sports performance staff and athletes now can do mental skills training work (and save paper) by using the Concentration Grid app on their mobile device.\n\nThe Concentration Grid app is intended to provide competitive challenge and a fun experience that is simple and straightforward ... like the printed paper grid exercise - but more convenient.  \n\nNothing fancy.  Nothing distracting.  Nothing flashy.  Only the grid.  Numbers.  Black. White. Red.  No on-screen timer or visible ticking clock.  \n\nFocus.  Concentration.\n\nWith the Concentration Grid app the level and nature of the challenge can be varied by changing the size of the grid - by selecting the number of rows and columns for the grid.  \n\nGrids can be generated in a variety of sizes - from 3 columns/rows to 14 columns/rows.  (A grid does not have to have the same number of rows and columns.)  More rows/columns, more numbers.  More numbers, more time.\n\nTry a 3x3 grid ... a 3x14 grid ... a 7x7 grid ... a 7x10 grid ... a 10x10 grid .... a 10x14 grid ... a 14x14 grid.   You get the idea.\n\nThe standard is a 10x10 grid - which a focused grid master should be able to complete in under 4 minutes.\n\nOther benchmarks ...\nA 3x3 grid can be completed in about 3 seconds.\nA 5x5 grid might be completed in under 15 seconds.\nA 7x7 grid can be completed by a master in well under a minute.\nA 9x9 grid might be completed in 3 minutes.\nA 14x14 grid will take well over 10 minutes to complete.\n\nTest yourself:  Can you complete a 6x6 grid in under 30 seconds? \n\nSmaller grids will call for dexterity and quick vision as well as focus/concentration.\n\nLarger grids will challenge your ability to sustain focus/concentration ... your mental stamina is put to the test.\n\nChallenge yourself with Concentration Grid.  Track and measure your improvement as you practice.  Then compare your best grid times against the best grid times of teammates and others ... who is the fastest?  Who is a master of the grid?  (Coaches and teachers can set up intrasquad competitions/tournaments to find out.)\n\nPractice makes perfect.   Sustained attention and effort are rewarded with improved performance/times in the grid exercise.\n\nThe grid exercise can be practiced in quiet places/at home or during road trips or during school/practices ... or under loud/distracting (game day) conditions.  Parents/teachers might have their children/students use the exercise regularly to practice and improve concentration ability.  In a world filled with distractions, anyone can use Concentration Grid to practice focus skills. \n\nThe Concentration Grid app will provide your grid time (elapsed time to complete the grid exercise) as well as a GRID_ID data set that includes additional information about your performance.  The app will also maintain a history/file for you to monitor your performance/improvement.  \n\nAnd Concentration Grid includes a SHARE feature which will allow you to share/post your grid times and screenshots on social media or to a leaderboard (community site).\n\nThe Concentration Grid app is perfect for coaches, athletes, students, teachers/educators, sports performance/psychology staff, parents, children, adults - young and old ....\n\nChallenge yourself.  Make self-development a daily habit.  \n\nWebsite - www.concentrationgrid.com\nCommunity - www.concentrationgrid.net",

    "description": "Due remembers all the things that you need so you don't have to.\n\nBecause it repeatedly reminds you of things until you act on them, it‘s impossible to forget anything.\n\nMost importantly, it's lightning-fast to set and postpone reminders, all thanks to a clever time picker and natural date parsing.\n\n\nKEY FEATURES\n\n1. Persistent & Effective\nAuto Snooze repeatedly* notifies you of missed reminders until marked done or rescheduled. Choose between intervals of every 1, 5, 10, 15, 30 and 60 minutes.\n\n2. Fast to Set, Fast to Postpone\nA time picker with 12 preset and fully customizable times lets you set due dates and postpone reminders in record time.\n\n3. Natural Date & Time Parsing\nDue can also parse dates and times that you typed or dictate and offer to set the due dates and times for you.\n\n4. Countdown Timers\nPrecise to the second, perfect for making the perfect soft-boiled eggs, brewing your coffee and more. Set them up once and reuse them forever\n\n5. Powerful Recurring Reminders\nFrom the simple daily and weekly reminders to the complex every-3rd-Wednesday-of-the-month kind of reminders\n\n6. Keep in Sync**\nUse iCloud or Dropbox to keep your reminders and timers in sync across your iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\n7. Works Offline, Completely Private\nThere is no account to sign up for. We don't store, and we can't access your reminders and timers. And you don't need internet to receive reminders.\n\n8. Accessible to Everyone\nAutomatically adjusts text size according to your system setting, and offers full VoiceOver support. Due is also localized in 17 languages.\n\n\n* By default, auto snooze repeats 5 times, and can be configured to repeat up to 10 times. Due can auto snooze any overdue items indefinitely when you launch Due or act on any of its notifications.\n** Sync on Mac requires Due for Mac (sold separately)\n\n\nWHAT'S THAT IN-APP PURCHASE ABOUT?\n\nWhen you purchase Due today, you will have access to every feature in the app today—no further purchase required.\n\nYou will also get access to all new features released one year from your date of purchase.\n\nThe optional Due Upgrade Pass subscription allows you to continue getting access to all new features released one year *after* your date of purchase.\n\nAnd here's the deal: Every feature that you have unlocked will remain available to you, forever—even if you stop subscribing.\n\nShould you choose not to subscribe, after one year, you will continue to receive updates in the form of bug fixes and compatibility updates with the latest devices, iOS, iPadOS and watchOS.\n\nDue has a pretty good track record with that.\n\nTo illustrate: If you purchased Due back in 2010 for your iPhone 3G running iOS 4 then, that very same app in 2020 is now optimized for iPhone 11 Pro Max, iPad Pro running iOS 13, as well as on Apple Watch—and you don’t have to pay a single cent more to use the app on these devices, on the new iOS.\n\n\nTERMS & PRIVACY POLICY\n\nOur terms of use and privacy policy is available here: https://www.dueapp.com/terms.html\n\n\nCOMPATIBILITY\n\nDue requires an iPhone, iPod touch or iPad running iOS 12 or later.",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength. All this data appears on the dash and can be managed with the mode switch, keeping your hands where they belong: on the handlebar.",

Sales of this app support the development of both the computer and mobile version, which is why the app is priced as a computer application.\n\nAnkiMobile offers some features not found in other flashcard apps:\n\n- A free cloud synchronization service that lets you keep your card content synchronized across multiple mobile and computer devices. This makes it easy to add content on a computer and then study it on your mobile, easily keep your study progress current between an iPhone and iPad, and so on.\n- The same proven scheduling algorithm that the computer version of Anki uses, which reminds you of material as you're about to forget it.\n- A flexible interface designed for smooth and efficient study. You can set up AnkiMobile to perform different actions when you tap or swipe on various parts of the screen, and control which actions appear on the tool buttons.\n- Comprehensive graphs and statistics about your studies.\n- Support for large card decks - even 100,000+ cards.\n- If your cards use images or audio clips, the media is stored on your device, so you can study without an internet connection.\n- A powerful search facility that allows you to find cards that match criteria such as 'tagged high priority, answered in the last ten days and not containing the following words', and automatically place them into a deck to study.\n- Support for displaying mathematical equations with MathJax, and rendering LaTeX created with the computer version.\n- Support for adding images drawn with the Apple Pencil to your cards.\n\nPlease note that AnkiMobile is currently intended as a companion to the computer version of Anki, rather than a complete replacement for it. While AnkiMobile is able to display and schedule your cards in the same way the computer version does, certain changes like modifying note types need to be done with the computer software. Add-ons are not supported, so while you can study image occlusion cards created with the computer version, they can not be created within AnkiMobile. For this reason, please start with the computer version of Anki before you think about buying this app.\n\nThe cloud synchronization service is optional, and data can also be imported/exported from the app via a USB cable or AirDrop.\n\nLike all apps, AnkiMobile can be purchased once and then used on multiple devices in a household using the same Apple ID. Family sharing is also supported. For information on bulk discounts for educational institutions, please see Apple's Volume Purchase Program.\n\nFor more information on AnkiMobile, including a link to the online manual, please have a look at the support page: https://docs.ankimobile.net/\n\nIf you have any questions or want to report an issue, please let us know on our support site and we'll get back to you as soon as possible.",

    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera. Like its sister app Halide, the app is easily usable with one hand, even on the largest iPhones.\n\nHIGH-TECH SHOWCASE \n\nBuild with the latest tech, Spectre isn't just a long exposure camera — it’s the cutting edge technology showcase of one of the App Store’s foremost camera apps, Halide. Here’s just a few of the latest technologies that we use in Spectre:\n\n- DCI-P3 Wide Color Pipeline\n- Live Photos\n- Metal Graphics Acceleration\n- Tripod Detection\n- Siri & Shortcuts\n- AI Stabilization\n- Machine Learning & CoreML\n- Computer Vision\n\nCOMPATIBILITY:\n\nSpectre’s smart Automatic Scene Detection requires iOS 12. AI-based stabilization features are available on iPhone 6S and later.* For the best experience, we recommend iPhone 8 or later.\n\nOn iPhone 6, Spectre captures in lower resolution. \n\n* (Full compatibility device list: iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus, iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, iPhone XR, iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max)\n\nABOUT US \n\nWe’re Ben and Sebastiaan, two friends living in the San Francisco Bay Area that love building fantastic apps for photography. \n\nWe hope you love Spectre! We’d love your feedback to make it even better or any reports of bugs you run into. You can always contact us directly via email: support@halide.cam, on our Twitter: @halidecamera or Instagram: @halideapp\n\nDon’t forget to share your amazing results by tagging them with #SpectreShot so we can share them on our growing social media accounts!",

It reflects India's culture through the Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian and civil festivals happening all along the year. Nearly all the festivals are illustrated with a colorful image.\n\nThe calendar covers the full 2021 year. It also contains all the information from year 2009.\n\nIt contains all the details about the lunar cycles (Tithi and Karana), the planets (Nakshatra), the moon/sun combinaisons (Yoga), the full moons or purnima, the new moon or amavasaya, ... along with the Sunrise and Sunset timings.\n\nWhat's included:\n- Sun, Thithi and Nakshatra timings for several cities in India (Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata) and around the World: Paris, London, Geneva, Moscow,New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Denver, Los Angeles, Cape Town, Toronto, Melbourne, Sydney, Tokoy, Abu Dhabi, Singapore, Hawaii, St Denis Réunion, Kuweit City, Colombo, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur. The timings are taking the daylight savings into account.\n Panchak for every month\n- At startup, the current month will be displayed, with an emphasis on the current day.

If your city is not in the list, you just select the closest one.\n\nWith the search tool, you can:\n- Write \"Prad\", you'll get the full list of Pradosh vrat of the year (worship of Lord Shiva, which is observed on the Trayodashi of both the fortnight - Shukla and Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Eka\", you'll get the full list of Ekadashi of the year (Ekadashi occurs on the 11th day of the bright half - called Shukla Paksha and on the 11th of the dark half called Krishna Paksh)\n- Write \"Chatur\", you'll get the full list of Ganesha and Vinayak Chaturthi of the year\n- Write \"Rohini\" or \"Ashtami\", and so on...\n\nOur calendar complied a Hindu Panchang according to Vedic science and modern outlook.

    "description": "GeoShred Pro Version 5, is an exciting update, now with In-App-Purchases for GeoSWAM instruments on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater.  \n\nImagine a new kind of musical instrument ... \n\nAn instrument where a performer can fluidly express multiple independent voices.  An instrument that is both pitch fluid, and helps the performer precisely reach desired musical pitches in any temperament.  \n\nGeoShred is an award-winning,  fluidly expressive musical instrument that runs on multi-touch devices. \n\nIt has a performance surface with “almost magic” pitch rounding algorithms which is coupled with a model of the physics of several types of musical instruments, support for AUv3, MIDI In/Out, MPE, and 3D Touch.  It’s a fusion of Jordan Rudess’ performance concepts and a powerful, modeled guitar/effects based on the Physical Modeling research of Dr. Julius O. Smith III of Stanford/CCRMA.  And, GeoShred's expressive control can be used with other synthesizers.\n\nTens of thousands of artists in 48 countries perform GeoShred with 30% of those users in India. \n\nGeoShred is the Gold Medal Winner of the 2019 Denny Award, winner of a 2019 Guthman New Musical Instrument Award, and winner of the 2017 Electronic Musician Editor's Choice Award as \"one of the most innovative, groundbreaking products to emerge in the past twelve months\".\n\n\nGeoShred Pro Version 5 Features include:\n\n• In-App-Purchases (IAP) for 6 different GeoSWAM instruments, GeoViolin, GeoFlute, GeoTenoSax, GeoCello, GeoClarinet, and GeoOboe \n• A fluidly expressive playing surface + a Physically modeled guitar\n• Au3 plugin support on devices running iOS 11.4 or greater \n• Intelligent pitch rounding\n• A diatonic keyboard where every key on the screen is in the scale.\n• MIDI IN/OUT and MPE support\n• MIDI control using Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, virtual MIDI and all digital interfaces \n• MIDI configuration presets\n• 3D touch on iPhones that support 3D touch\n• Customizable control surface can be mapped to physical MIDI controls\n• Inter-App Audio and Audiobus support.\n• Backing tracks\n• Multiple Modeled effects\n• Modeled feedback and VCF effects\n• Echo, a unique looper and multi-tap echo \n• Finger vibrato, slide and fret scraping\n• Unique mono mode using intervals of multiple strings. \n• Built-in Arpeggiator\n• Alternative tunings and temperaments\n• Support for world scales and temperaments including Indian Ragas, Arabic and Balinese scales. \n• Easily share presets with friends\n\n---\n \nPraise for the GeoShred family of apps: \n\n“GeoShred is brilliant- it’s a real instrument.” – Eddie Jobson\n\n“A fantastic new invention which is going to revolutionize the way music is played, expressed and learned! “GeoShred” is one of the foremost best musical inventions I’ve had the pleasure to experience in recent years. Definitely 5 stars out of 5! GIGANTASTIVISSIMO…..R…A…Z !!!!!” – Patrick Moraz\n\n“That’s just nuts. You’re [Jordan] the best-guitarist-without-a-guitar of all time” – Joe Satriani\n\n“GeoShred is a breakthrough [musical instrument] for the iPad. Some might think it’s the best evidence yet that there has indeed been reverse engineering of alien technology, but if that’s the case, then aliens play guitar…and worship Jimi Hendrix.” – Craig Anderton Harmony Central\n\n---\n\nWe are dedicated to offering the highest level of musical instrument experience for our customers worldwide.  It would mean a lot to us if you could leave your positive review on the App Store and If you have any questions about GeoShred we would love to hear from you at our support email address: support@moforte.com \n\n---\n\nMinimum Requirements:  iOS 11.4 or better is required for AUv3, iCloud and GeoSWAM instruments.\n***Note: The GeoSWAM instruments can ONLY be performed from the GeoShred keyboard or MPE controllers.\n***Note: Unfortunately, due to App Store limitations, previously purchased instrument IAPs can not be applied to a purchase of the collection IAP.",

You can keep receiving calls, in other applications and the sounds are still working. While you are in your moment. OFFTIME and use your phone, the application will send you notifications so you know you are not fulfilling it. Once I used it for more than 30 seconds, the OFFTIME moment is considered canceled \n- Extended OFFTIME programming, to define specific punctual dates.\n - OFFTIME events: you will now be able tu invite your iOS Friends and family to a joint OFFTIME event.

    "description": "Auto-Tune Mobile brings vocal pitch correction to vocal performance, using Antares' world-class Auto-Tune® technology.  Now Antares' professional pitch correction recording studio technology is available for local performers to use live, on stage, or in recording apps on your iPhone / iPad.\n\nThe Auto-Tune Mobile app does not do anything until you sing through it. When you sing, Auto-Tune Mobile detects what note you are singing, and corrects the pitch of your notes, to the nearest valid note, from the ones you select on the screen. The corrected vocals go out through the speakers (when you turn on Audio Out); also Auto-Tune Mobile is compatible with other apps if you wish to record.\n\nConnect Auto-Tune Mobile to your sound system between your microphone and your P.A. / speakers to use Auto-Tune Mobile in a live performance setting.  Use a microphone audio interface device to connect the 1/8 inch jack to your microphone line and the headphone output to your sound system.  Turn on Audio Out on the Auto-Tune Mobile app to get audio to pass through the system.  If you turn on Audio Out without connecting to your sound system, you are likely to hear the internal feedback of the internal speaker to the internal mic.  Adjust your mic and speakers so there is no feedback.\n\nVocals are corrected to the nearest pitch based on the key and scale of the song, or to a set of melody notes selected on the screen.  Use the Chromatic scale when you don't know what key or scale a song is in.  This is the easiest way to correct your voice to the nearest pitch.\n\nThe Retune speed is the time it takes for Auto-Tune to pitch correct your voice. The Normal Retune speed is a setting of 50 msecs -- this gives a natural humanized pitch correction effect. Normal Retune speed is appropriate for a moderate tempo song, for example a song at 120 bpm with a melody in eighth notes. \n\nA funky or fast tempo tune, or a song requiring sixteenth note precision, will likely require a Fast Retune speed. The Fast Retune speed corrects notes within 25 msecs; this is better for faster notes.  For slow songs or ballads featuring long held notes, the Slow Retune speed (75 msecs) may provide a more natural sound.\n\nIn addition to natural sounding pitch correction, you can also apply the iconic Auto-Tune effect. The Auto-Tune effect in essence retunes your pitch immediately (in 0 msecs). Ironically, if you sing really well, there is not much correction for Auto-Tune to do. The Auto-Tune effect is most noticeable when you are off key or you slide into a note. Also when you set the app to the Auto-Tune Effect setting, a meter appears at the top (red bouncing ball) that visually indicates whether you are singing sharp or flat. \n\nThe Bypass button is provided as a quick way to stop and start adding the effect as you sing.\n\nAuto-Tune Mobile conforms to the Inter-App Audio (IAA) standard so you can use Auto-Tune with your other IAA apps.  Notice when using with GarageBand that the Auto-Tune filter takes effect as you record the track.  If you want to pitch correct a pre-existing vocal you will need to replay it outside of GarageBand and re-record it to a new track.  Midi control of pitch correction is included, so you can connect a Midi keyboard and direct the vocals to sing on a particular melody or on a set of scale notes as pressed on the keyboard.  Midi note presses will show up in red on the app.\n\nAuto-Tune Mobile is Audiobus compatible, allowing Auto-Tune Mobile to work with your other iOS music apps.  Auto-Tune Mobile acts as a filter in the “Effects” category, so you can apply pitch correction and the Auto-Tune effect to other Audiobus-compatible apps.  (see http://audiob.us).\n\n* Vocal real-time pitch correction designed for live performance\n* Compatible with other IAA and Audiobus apps\n* Built with Antares Audio Technologies' Auto-Tune® professional pitch correction\n* Tested with Tascam iXZ and IK Multimedia's iRig microphone audio interfaces.\n* Made for musicians.",

(yeah, it has happened, check the press).\n\nThey would have access to your entire life: pictures, videos, contacts, whatsapp conversations, facebook chats, emails (which mean access to any of your online accounts via password reset), etc.\nThey might even install malware to spy on you remotely!\n\nTHE WORST PART IS YOU WILL NEVER KNOW THAT SOMEONE HAD ACCESS TO YOUR DEVICE. \nThat you need to change your password. That a tracking virus is running on your device. That you have to alert your bank. That your competitor has stolen your confidential data.  That your partner knows about \"those\" pictures and conversations and you'd better prepare a good excuse....\nThat people you trust don't respect your privacy!\n\n\n+++ HOW IT WORKS +++\n! THE SIMPLEST APP EVER !\n1. open the App\n2. lock the screen\n\nThat's it! Your device is Secured!\n\nYou will immediately receive a notification on the lock-screen. The notification will remain there until the screen stays locked. If anyone unlocks the screen while you are away, the notification will not be there when you return, alerting you that someone had access to your device.\nThe notification changes every single time for extra security.\n\nThe History Log keeps track of the last notifications shown, so by-passing the system is virtually impossible. \n\n+++FEATURES +++\nDouble Function: use the app with STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS to catch anyone who is spying on you, or with DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS to let everybody know that you are monitoring any access to the device.\n\nYou choose what appears on the notification: \n\n+ STEALTH NOTIFICATIONS (simulate a useful notification, to disguise the true nature of iAmNotified)\n- Lucky Lottery Numbers - [Who doesn't play the lottery?  I mean... free money, right?!]\n- Famous Citations - [Because everyone needs some inspirational quotes every now and then]\n- Definition of a Complex Word - [Education is important! Anyone would want to expand his vocabulary]\n- Fake Stock Exchange Alert - [These are total random companies symbols and values. Not real data to be sued in the stock market!]\n\n+ DETERRENT NOTIFICATIONS (showing that you are monitoring the device, will discourage people from accessing it)\n- Custom Message - [You choose what appears on the notification]\n- \"Device locked at: #current date and time#\" - [Shows the time of the last screen lock]\n- \"Access to this device is monitored. Unique notification ID: #securityID#\" \n\n*** PRO OPTIONS ***\nImprove your stealthiness with these advanced options\n\n- Secret Lock -> Launch iAmNotified without anyone near you noticing. When the option is activated, a black dimmed screen is shown when the app is opened, simulating the lock screen. Now you can secretly press the lock button to lock the screen, or wait for it to lock automatically. To access the app with the option activated, simply tap anywhere on the black screen.\n\n- Random Notification Time -> The notification appears at a random time within 2 minutes from the screen lock, instead of immediately after\n\nStart to feel in control of your device!",

Based on extensive literature review, Ortho Traumapedia compiles the current standard of care in a high-yield, easy to use format including dozens of original images to help visualize fracture patterns and radiologic findings. \n\nOriginally developed by orthopedic surgeons for orthopedic surgeons, practitioners of all levels and specialties who encounter adult skeletal trauma will find Ortho Traumapedia useful as a condensed reference and educational tool. Whether you’re a primary care or emergency physician, physician’s assistant, nurse practitioner, resident or medical student, Ortho Traumapedia provides highly pertinent information regarding skeletal trauma right at your fingertips. \n\nOrtho Traumapedia is organized into chapters by bone (for fractures) and joint (for dislocations). Each chapter is divided into four sections: Facts, Imaging, Classification and Treatment: \n\nFacts begins with epidemiology and common injury mechanisms. This is followed by an outline of pertinent anatomy, eponyms and variants. Finally, patient presentation, examination and management tips are presented. \n\nImaging begins with the standard radiographic examinations for each anatomic region. This is followed by injury-specific views, relevant metrics and findings as well as supplemental modalities. \n\nClassification outlines the most common classification systems used to describe the selected injury. \n\nTreatment begins with general treatment principles and reviews treatment in the acute setting. This is followed by standard of care options grouped by injury pattern. Common complications associated with the injury are included at the end of this section. \n\nSimply select the bone or joint you’re interested in from the main menu and navigate between the four sections with the buttons on the bottom of the screen. Return to the main menu by pressing the left arrow in the title bar. There's never been a simpler, more mobile skeletal trauma reference!",

It is a 4-stringed instrument with a base made from cured pumpkin gourd and a stem made from wood.\n________________________________________\n\n◆ AND NOW PRESENTING - iTanpura ◆\niTanpura is an electronic Tanpura for the iPhone and iPod Touch. It uses stereo digital sound to simulate a set of two tanpuras each of which can be tuned with a different string combination. It uses sounds sampled from real Hemraj tanpuras to provide beautiful yet realistic sound in a pleasing and intuitive package. And now iTanpura also includes fantastic Swar Mandal sound (with presets for 75+ raags) for an instant concert atmosphere guaranteed to inspire! iTanpura is ideal for everyday music practice, concerts, or even as a serene background for meditation.\n\nYouTube demo: http://upasani.org/itanpura\n________________________________________\n\n◆ KEY FEATURES ◆\n√ FOUR fantastic instruments in one app: includes two 5-string tanpuras with independent pan and volume controls, a 15-string Swar Mandal, and a Sur-Peti/Shruti Box\n√ Uses sounds sampled from actual male & female tanpuras for realistic tanpura sound throughout the pitch range\n√ Wide range of pitch from lower A (A2) through upper E (E4) for one and a half octaves of tuning\n√ INTEGRATED AUTO-TUNER: Auto-Tune iTanpura to your instrument such as harmonium, or use it to tune other instruments (microphone capability required such as iPhone built-in mic or 2nd/3rd generation iPod Touch with external microphone)\n√ BACKGROUND PLAY: Start playing the tanpuras and switch to another app, or play along with iPod music\n√ Integrated 15-string Swar Mandal - completely tunable & can be played manually OR set to auto-loop\n√ Suitable for Hindustani or Carnatic, vocal or instrumental music \n√ Fine-tune pitch in cents. The display shows the fine-tune value to allow exact recreation of any pitch\n√ Play one or two simultaneous tanpuras both controlled by the master pitch controls\n√ Each tanpura's first string can be tuned to Pa, Ma or Ni, or any custom note such as Re, Ga, Dha, etc \n√ Or tune first string to any shruti in the octave using a slider\n√ Each tanpura has its own pan and volume controls to allow precise placement within the stereo image. For example you can have a tanpura with Pa on your left and one with Ni on your right\n√ PRESETS: Save your favorite settings as named presets. Includes presets for the 100+ most popular raags. And now you can also export/import presets via email or iTunes File Sharing.\n√ Turn the Sur-Peti/Shruti Box on or off and adjust its volume from the settings page\n√ Can be used with speakers, headset, or the internal speaker (a high-quality speaker dock is recommended for maximum effect)\n________________________________________\n\nNot yet convinced?

It is the best way to make very high quality 360 panorama photo within 10-30 seconds. \n\nWouldn’t you like a view of the really big 360 panorama picture?\n\nOrdinary cameras seldom capture the full impact of breathtaking landscapes, city scenes and tall buildings. Even if you’ve got a wide angle lens, it’s hard to squeeze everything into the frame and do the scene justice.\n\nTo pack more into the picture, photographers traditionally use the \ntrick of shooting several frames, shifting the camera’s position to capture different parts of the scene. These shots are combined to create one extra-large image. However it’s a fiddly manual process \nthat demands skill and patience to stitch frames together without obvious joins.\n\nNow there’s a fun, easy way to create seamless, ultra-wide pictures with a huge field of view of up to 360 degrees, that’s equivalent to a wide angle lens wie in one frame. It is easy and quick.\n\nPano Camera 360 takes the hard work out of creating fabulous panoramic shots. And best of all, you don’t need a Computer or special software: everything’s done for you inside the iPhone.\n\nPanorama 360 Camera can automatically capture and combine a high-speed burst of full-resolution images.Just click the shutter button and sweep the camera clockwise from left to right (or right to left) across your scene.
