    "description": "\"Spectre is a new iOS camera app that uses AI to create stunning long exposures” — the Verge\n\nIntroducing Spectre, from the makers of Halide, one of the top camera apps in the App Store.\n\nSpectre uses AI to help you make amazing long exposure photographs. Spectre can remove crowds, turn city streets into rivers of light, make waterfalls look like paintings, and much more. Until now, it was difficult to take long exposures: from keeping the camera steady to guessing the amount of light you need. Spectre takes care of all of that!\n\nWHAT YOU CAN DO\n\n• MAKE CROWDS DISAPPEAR: Spectre helps take photos of crowded, touristy places. Simply set a medium or long duration and take a shot to erase the crowd from a location. Capture the those special moments like you remember them.\n\n• RIVERS OF LIGHT: At night, AI scene detection automatically switches modes to draw beautiful light trails, for stunning nighttime city photography or light painting.\n\n• GORGEOUS WATER: Capture waterfalls, ocean waves, fountains and more with beautiful ghostly water. \n\nLIVE PHOTOS AND VIDEO\n\nSpectre’s intelligent computational shutter takes hundreds of shots over the span of a few seconds, and saves them in an accompanying live photo. That means you can pick a different frame as your photo, apply live-photo effects, and even use the long exposure as a live-wallpaper!\n\nENDLESS SMARTS\n\nSpectre is a packed with powerful technology from by the team that brought you Halide.\n\nFrom machine learning-based scene detection to computer vision aided image stabilization, Spectre is jammed full of impressive technologies to get the best possible image.\n\nDESIGNED FOR HUMANS\n\nSpectre is meticulously designed. Its dark UI is gentle on the eyes when you shoot at night. Gorgeous glowing highlights infuse it with a unique style. Custom typefaces and iconography combined with unique, smooth controls make it as tactile and delightful as an actual physical camera.

This tactical top-down shooter puts you in the shoes of specialist Burton in his hunt for dangerous fugitives after a disastrous prison break.\n\nTACTICAL COMBAT\nUse the environment to your advantage. Avoid attacks by taking cover. Flank enemies for extra efficiency, but avoid getting flanked yourself! Use the tools of the trade to gain an edge - frag grenades, flash bangs, distractions, personal shields, proximity mines and more.\n\nSTEALTH\nChoose your approach with care. Some say running into the fray guns blazing isn’t always the best option. Use distractions to single out opponents. Use disguises and covers to sneak past irrelevant guards. Use silenced weapons to covertly reduce the enemy numbers.\n\nLOAD-OUTS & GEAR\nChoosing your load-out is a big part of your tactics. In addition to body armor and grenades you can carry one two-handed and one single-handed weapon in each mission - and there’s something for everyone. Shotguns, handguns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, crossbows, energy weapons, throwing axes and more.\n\n### IMPORTANT ### Please note that iPhone 4 is not supported.\n\n•\tTactical top-down shooter\n•\tEpisodic storyline in three chapters - ALL chapters out now!\n•\tGorgeous stylistic HD graphics rendered in Retina resolution (full Retina not supported on iPad 3)\n•\tOptimized for iOS 8 and Metal graphics!\n•\tWide range of weapons and gear\n•\tPerformance based mission rewards\n•\tMultiple factions to fight with or against – or pitch against each other \n•\tDual stick controls with a set of different options\n•\tMFi controller support (requires extended layout)\n•\tiCloud save game support\n•\tGameCenter achievements\n•       English, Deutsch, Français, Español, Italiano, 简体中文, 한국어, 日本語, русский, Português do Brasil",

    "description": "Struggle free, healthy and practical recipes that are easy on the wallet. It’s as simple as that, and it’s a message that’s seen over 1 million people follow FitMenCook on social media.\n\nBe honest, have you ever heard these complaints about healthy eating?\n\n- “Eating healthy is too expensive!”\n- “It takes too long! I don’t have hours to spend in the kitchen.”\n- “Healthy food is too bland”\n- “I always end up cheating and slipping back in to bad habits”\n\nKevin Curry, founder of FitMenCook, has been there. After spotting a picture of himself on a friend’s Facebook wall he knew it was time for a change.\n\nHe followed all the common advice, changed to a healthy diet and started hitting the gym.\n\nFor a few months, things were great, but after a while he found himself craving the old foods he was trying so hard to avoid.\n\nHe got his hands on every book he could find on nutrition and started experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nHis aims were simple:\n\nA) Food should be easy to prepare and affordable\nB) Food should be vibrant and tasty, never boring\nC) Preparing food in advance is important\nD) Following a, b, c helps you achieve your fitness goals\n\nThe results for Kevin were game change and now he’s spreading message to the FitMenCook community on social media and inside the FMC app.\n\nTop 5 features:\n\n#1\nSHOPPING CART + APPLE WATCH\n\nWe've taken the hassle out of grocery shopping. Add any recipes you want to your shopping list and we'll organise the list by aisle, so you can easily find the items you need.\n\nThe shopping list also works on the Apple Watch.\n\n#2\nEASY STEP BY STEP VIDEO INSTRUCTIONS\n\nIf you’ve ever looked at recipe instructions and thought “this just looks too difficult for me” then you’ll find the included recipe videos very helpful. Not only is Kevin a great host, who’ll fill you with inspiration for healthy meals, but he’ll also break down the steps in a way that’s easy to follow.\n\n#3\nFOCUS ON MEAL PREP\n\nBuying ingredients in small quantities can make recipes more expensive. Not only that, but many of us don’t have time every day to spend in the kitchen.\n\nMeal prep is the solution. By designating two days of the week as your main cooking days, you can prepare your meals in bulk and eat healthy all week.\n\nThis is a crucial part of the app, and many of the meals are designed with meal preparation in mind, to make healthy living fit with a busy life.\n\n#4\nMACRO COUNTING AND INTEGRATION WITH APPLE HEALTH APP\n\nBodybuilders and fat-loss superheroes can rejoice as the FitMenCook app has nutritional information built right in! Recipes list calories, protein, carbs and fat. This data can then be shared with the Apple Health app.\n\n5#\nSCALE UP A RECIPE\n\nIncrease the serving sizes by tapping the + and - buttons in the recipe view. You can also switch the measurements between metric and imperial.\n\nThere’s more including:\n- 750+ recipes with more added each month\n- Search by ingredient: Type in Egg Avocado to see all recipes containing both of these ingredients\n- Share recipes with friends and family\n- Available in English and Spanish\n\nFor a video demonstration of the app in action, take a look at: http://fitmencook.com/app/\n\nOptional Meal Planner Subscription:\nFitMenCook Pro is available as a monthly (0.99 USD) or yearly (5.99 USD) subscription. The subscription will automatically renew unless cancelled at least 24 hours prior to the end of the subscription period. There is no increase in price when renewing. Payment will be charged through your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. Once purchased, refunds will not be provided for any unused portion of the term.

    "description": "\"Unruly Heroes” is a 2D action-adventure mobile game developed by the indie team at Magic Design Studios and published by Perfect World. The story is inspired by China’s first mythological novel \"Journey to the West” and strives to bring players an innovative experience through a fantastical art style and hilarious plot.\nSince the dawn of time, Buddhist scripture held the balance between Heaven, Earth, and the myriad creatures. However, as Evil’s wickedness began to grow, this delicate balance was thrown into chaos when the divine scripture was torn to pieces and scattered across the land. Those creatures that have encountered the mythical power of the fragments inherited unprecedented power. In doing so, this newfound strength kindled their heart’s innermost wickedness, turning them into horrifying monsters. With a world in chaos, a master and his three disciples accept Guan Yin’s decree and set out to reunite the fragments into a new scripture.\nThe game follows the journey of a master and his three disciples as they fight, solve puzzles, collect loot, parkour, platform and more on their mystical demon-slaying adventure. You must capitalize on their special attacks and holy relics in a battle of wit and bravery against demons to complete their pilgrimage in reuniting the scripture.\nFollowing its release on Steam and consoles, the mobile edition of “Unruly Heroes” is now available!\nHighlights:\nFantastic hand-drawn art style—Rich and in-depth level design illustrates a vivid sense of realism.\nSwitch between the master and disciples—Effortlessly switch between the four characters both in and out of combat to overcome puzzles and obstacles.\nRich and varied gameplay—Over ten different gameplay elements including: fighting, puzzle solving, loot collecting, parkour, platforming and more.\n\nAwards\n“Unruly Heroes” won the 47th Annie Award for best game character animation.\n\nFacebook: @UnrulyHeroesGame\nDeveloper Info: Magic Design Studios\nOfficial website: www.magicdesignstudios.com",

Because now, you can harness this powerful and mysterious effect right from your iPhone.\n\nWhen faced with a tough choice, Universe Splitter allows you to live out BOTH of your options... in separate realities.* No mere coin-flip app can make this claim!\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nLet's say you have to make a difficult decision — for example, whether to accept a job offer or to turn it down. Just type both actions into your Universe Splitter, and press the \"Split Universe\" button.\n\nUniverse Splitter will then, over the internet, activate a remote \"Quantis\" brand quantum device (made by id Quantique, and certified by the National Metrology Institute of Switzerland) which will send a single photon into a quantum \"either/or\" state. According to current scientific thinking, though, the photon will actually be in a \"both, but in separate universes\" state!\n\nWithin seconds, Universe Splitter will report to you which of those two universes you’re in, and by taking a different action in each, you will cause these previously identical universes to diverge.*\n\nOf course, you won't be able to see or interact with that other universe. In fact, you may question whether anything at all happened. But according to the prevailing quantum theory, there will be two of you pondering whether anything just happened!\n\nRight now you're probably wondering: Does this app genuinely contact a quantum device in Geneva? YES, it absolutely does, and we would be happy to provide proof of this upon request. Email eric@aerfish.com for more info.\n\nAs BDembko writes: \"The real joke... is that it's NOT a joke.  Which actually makes it funnier, if you ask me.  (Kind of an Andy Kaufman kind of thing)  The guy actually went the extra 10 miles... and it seems so absurd to us, that we figure it's a joke.  But it's not... which then means it is.  This is seriously quantum humor to the extreme.\"\n\nAnd -- if an infinite supply of universes isn't enough for you -- this app also gives you stylish, retro, machine-age graphics (complete with industrial-strength sound effects) which will underscore the awe-inspiring significance of each twist and turn of your ever-branching multiverse.\n\nIf you're a believer in the \"Many Worlds\" interpretation of quantum behavior, this app is a must. And if you're not, just think of this as THE most random of all coin-flip apps -- in that it uses the single most unpredictable thing in the known universe: a single quantum event!\n\n\n*According to prevailing quantum theory. Universes cannot contact each other. Not responsible for user's actions. ©Copyright 2009 Eric Daniels - All Rights Reserved",

The longer the shutter speed, the more light it will accumulate. You can even fine-tune the result using the exposure compensation slider to achieve the exact effect you want!\n\nHighlights:\n\n•  Unlimited Shutter Speed and manual ISO\n•  Option to resume capture \n•  Real time live preview - See the result in real time\n•  Innovative 'Freeze'  and ‘Blur Strength’ controls\n•  Tap to adjust focus/exposure\n•  Time-lapse Intervalometer\n•  Apple Watch support and handy Self-Timer \n•  Full resolution support on every devices\n\nWith Slow Shutter Cam on your iPhone or iPod touch you get the features of a DSLR camera with the convenience of a device that you can drop in your pocket and take with you wherever you go.

    "description": "Take your iPhone photo editing to the next level with Camera+ 2 - the best and most powerful photo capturing & editing app available. Camera+ 2 is designed by photo lovers on a mission to incorporate all the advances in photo technology that are being introduced year after year.\n \nPOWERFUL PHOTO EDITING\nThe Lab contains many photographic tools that allow you to fine-tune the exposure, boost the shadows,  sharpen your photo, and adjust curves among many others. Dozens of built-in filters help you get that final look. Our favorites system makes it easy to save, share, and apply your favorite sets of edits to many photos at once.\n \nRAW SHOOTING & EDITING\nRAW mode provides maximum flexibility for editing, by saving the exact image captured by the sensor at its full precision. The RAW Editor includes tools such as Curves and a White Balance picker. Use the RAW Editor to develop your images, or send them to your computer and use your current workflow.\n \nPHOTO LIBRARY INTEGRATION\nWe have achieved a fantastic integration with the photos you already have in your library. Instead of clunkily importing a photo you want to edit, doing your thing and saving it back, simply switch tabs and edit it right in place. And you'll love the multitasking support in iPad. The editors can also be used on the photos in your Photo Library. Switch between your library and the Lightbox by simply tapping a button, or use drag and drop gestures in the iPad. Files and iTunes integration are also available to easily transfer pictures to your computer or other apps.\n\nCAPTURE PRESETS\nCamera+ 2 adapts to your style and technical savvy. If you like the system camera, select the Auto preset to use a simple, clear interface that will let you concentrate on your shot. Camera+ 2 provides all the essential framing and exposure tools, and will select the best parameters for you.\n\nAs your skills progress, or if you are already familiar with DSLRs, you'll feel at home in Manual mode. You'll be able to select the best lens, shutter time, ISO or white balance for your capture.\n\nOther presets are available for purpose-specific captures, providing sensible settings for the task at hand. Slow Shutter allows you to take long exposures, even in daylight. Macro is optimized to work on close subjects, and Action tracks the object you select and automatically enables Burst so you don't miss the shot.\n \nINTRODUCING MAGIC ML\nMagic ML is our most advanced capture preset to date. It harnesses the power of machine learning to improve your photos as you shoot! But don't just take our word for it, try out Magic ML and see how much more your photography \"pops\"! And if you've already got photos you'd like to spruce up a bit, we've added a Magic ML adjustment in the Lab so you can add as much (or as little) wizardry as you'd like.\n\nTOTAL CONTROL\nIf your iPhone has multiple lenses, the Auto preset will use the best one(s) for your scene -just like the standard camera does- and will produce Deep Fusion pictures if it needs to. In Manual mode you are the boss: Camera+ 2 will always honor all the controls you choose. If you want to use the Tele lens, Camera+ 2 will not engage the digital zoom even if the Wide could gather more light. No more surprises after the fact.\n\nSHOOTING ASSIST TOOLS\nUse Smile mode to shoot when people are smiling, or Stabilizer to ensure your iPhone is steady enough to produce a sharp picture. Burst and Timer can also be enabled any time you need them.\n\nFocus Peaking highlights the parts of the image that are in focus, which is invaluable if you are focusing manually. Zebra Stripes detect those parts of your composition that are over- or underexposed.\n\nDEPTH CAPTURE\nDepth Capture, which is optimized for person subjects, is available in iPhones with dual or triple cameras, and in the iPhone XR. Depth information is saved alongside the image, and the adjustments in The Lab can be selectively applied to distant or close subjects.",

While this app will install and function on all devices supported by iOS 13, all devices outside of this list will be restricted to recording video from on a single camera.\n\nDoubleTake gives you an early look at the multi-cam capability that will be coming to our award-winning cinema camera app FiLMiC Pro.  \n\nUse DoubleTake to record video in new ways:\n\n- Camera Visualization:  Better than a director’s viewfinder!  Use DoubleTake’s camera picker view to visualize all available cameras for your device.  Use this view to help decide how to frame your shot and which cameras you will select.\n\n- Shot/Reverse shot:  To capture all the organic and intimate interaction between two actors or interviewer and interviewee.  Traditionally, filmmakers would need to employ two cameras and place these in cumbersome ‘over the shoulder’ locations.  With DoubleTake you can place one device in between your actors and place the audience right in the middle of the conversation.\n\n- Multi-cam:  Capture two different focal lengths of the same subject at the same time.  Use DoubleTake with the Ultra Wide lens (iPhone 11 Pro Max, 11 Pro and 11 only) and the Tele to capture both an establishing shot and a punch-in on your subject simultaneously. Or use any other combination of front and rear lenses for unrivaled multi-cam capture.\n\n- PiP or Discreet:  The DoubleTake interface allows you to see both cameras of your video capture at the same time through the use of a Picture in Picture (PiP) window.  You can move this PiP around the screen, tap to zoom in, or swipe it away if it’s distracting (the second video will continue to record).  With DoubleTake you can decide if you want to record your videos as separate discrete files or if you want the video recorded as a composite video that includes the PiP window animated as you see it on the screen.\n\n- Split-screen: Doubletake also allows you to use any two cameras to create a 50/50 split-screen effect that is saved as a single video. This is great for capturing engaging interviews, or any scenario where two sides of the story need equal weighting on screen.\n\n- Focus & Exposure Controls: DoubleTake allows you to set and lock your focus and exposure on both cameras during multi-cam capture with our unified reticle. Just tap anywhere to set an area of interest with the reticle, then tap again to lock or unlock. Our easy to use camera switcher lets you effortlessly move between your A and B cams during a recording to adjust the focus and exposure for each independently of one another.\n\nVideo Specs:\n- Full frame focus and exposure for smooth and easy automated focus and exposure adjustments.\n\n- Selectable broadcast frame rates:  24fps, 25fps, and 30fps depending on your project requirements.\n\n- 1080p video at high bitrate encoding for maximum quality.  (note: 1080p video is the maximum resolution supported by the Apple API for multi-cam capture).\n\n- Composited PiP or separate discreet video files recorded as .h264 .mov files are saved to DoubleTake’s internal library which supports batch export to the Camera Roll.",

Use the “Live” mode to provide the tala in real time in a Bhajan or Bharatanatyam setting. \n\nAs quoted in \"The Illustrated Companion To South Indian Classical Music\" by Ludwig Pesch: \n         \"A musician or dancer needs to acquire an ability to maintain an even tempo \n          (kalapramanam) if the finer nuances of rhythm are to be mastered\" \n\nTalanome lets you develop your kalapramanam and learn the invaluable art of following another's tempo which will help when transitioning to performances. \n\nTalanome is also a learning tool for the newcomer - learn about Carnatic Talas along the way with its extensive information and help sections. \n\nWith Talanome, you get:\n\n* Precision Sound Engine giving you precise timing at any tempo!\n\n* 175 Suladi Sapta Talas (the main system of Talas in Carnatic Music today)\n* 6 Chapu Talas (Tisra, Khanda, Misra, Viloma, Sankeera & Rupaka Chapu)\n* \"Make Your Own Talam/Choose Your Own Talam\" lets you explore more exotic talas and beats from other genres by transcribing them easily with our Tala Editor. Importing and exporting talas are a breeze, and you can share easily via email. \n\n* Talanome comes preloaded with\n   * all 108 Ashtottara Sata Talas,\n   * Dr. M.Balamuralikrishna's Mukhi Talas,\n   * B.C Manjunath's Fibonacci Tala,\n   * Fusion talas that Pete Lockett, a world renowned multi-percussionist, created and has kindly shared with us\n   * and now, Hindutani Taals! \n\n* Choose from 20 to 350 Aksharas per minute, with fine-grained control over tempo and the ability to easily change the Kalam by speeding up or slowing down the tempo by a factor of 2. \n\n* With the “Tap Tempo” feature, you can tap out the rhythm and Talanome will set it to the appropriate value!\n\n* Count-In support to help get the Talam started and for Eduppu/Graham\n\n* Nadai(Gathi) & Kalai support. Play the Talam with/without Nadai! Play it at different Kalais! Choose Chapu voicings for Nadai. \n\n* Keep track of the beat and follow along with a visual representation of the Talam and bold beat numbers or counting phrases (like Thekas) - switch between different representations by double tapping the Tala Visualizer. \n\n* Rich sound options: \n   * Great natural sound derived from a real Manjira and Nattuvangam \n   * Select from a pitch of 1 kattai (C) all the way to 7 kattai (B), with the ability to make fine-grained adjustments to tune to your choice of shruti\n   * Choose a hand clapping sound for a shruti neutral sound\n   * Ability to play alternate nadai sounds (mimicking Chapu talam voicings) \n\n* Talanome supports background play and keeps playing even when minimized. It supports mixing with other audio/apps, so if you want to practice with your favorite song or instrument, you can still keep the perfect beat! \n\n* Talanome supports Inter-App Audio with Host App controls and Synchronized Recording\n\n* Volume control - control the volume level directly from the app. Useful when mixing with other audio/apps. Turn it down completely if you only want visual cues.\n\n* Get detailed information about each Tala, including video demos\n* Learn more about Carnatic Talas in the reference section\n* Help section has a detailed write-up on Talanome’s abilities for your benefit\n\n* Fits in your pocket - no bulky boxes to carry around and it is a multi-functional educational tool to boot!\n* Supported on the iPad as a native app\n\nLike any good metronome, Talanome keeps a precise beat, which is important when you are trying to hone your skills, either while singing, playing a percussion instrument or dancing. With Talanome's sound engine, you get the precision of timing that you need and ought to expect!",

    "description": "The Secret to Money is an app that is designed to change the way you think about money, and to radically change the circumstances of money in your life.\n\nInspired by Rhonda Byrne's worldwide best selling phenomenon, The Secret, in this app you will develop a whole new perspective on your own personal finances and potential to live a life of abundance.\n\nThe Secret to Money is a personal development program of games and daily activities created by Rhonda Byrne herself, featuring 6 powerful Secret-inspired practices that will help you develop a wealth mindset:\n\nDESIRES\nPURCHASES\nMANIFESTED MONEY\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS\nAFFIRMATIONS\nGIVING\n\nDESIRES: In this practice, you create a list of 7 things you would buy if money were no object. This \"Secret\" list reminds you of why you want more money in your life, and what it would actually feel like to have the things you desire most.\n\nPURCHASES: In this practice, you will change your mindset about money by spending large amounts of money in your imagination. Every day, you will receive virtual checks in escalating amounts from the Bank of the Universe, as first introduced in The Secret book. Using your imagination, you “spend” each check on whatever you want or need, and record these purchases within the app. Currencies are localised for each country and set according to the language and location setting on the phone or tablet.\n\nMANIFESTED MONEY: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have manifested money today - money you have received, saved, were gifted or refunded. You will be surprised by how much \"Secret\" money you begin to manifest every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nDAILY INSPIRATIONS: When it comes to money, a little bit of inspiration goes a long way towards increasing the money in your life. In this daily practice, you will receive inspiring, financially themed messages drawn from The Secret books in order to help you change the way you think about money. Each inspiration is available to share.\n\nAFFIRMATIONS: Affirmations are positive statements that you make to create a positive mindset and change your life on a particular subject. In this daily practice, you will read 25 unique affirmations of wealth and abundance inspired by The Secret to help change your money mindset.\n\nGIVING: In this practice, you record all the ways that you have given to others - charitable donations, tips, gifts and giveaways, covering the check at dinner, or buying coffee for a friend.  You will be surprised by how much you give to others every day that you are practicing The Secret to Money.\n\nThe Secret to Money was designed specifically for you as your invitation to use The Secret in order to live the life of your dreams. As Rhonda says herself:\n\n\"Like many people, I was brought up with the belief that money is hard to come by, and that you have to work really hard for money. I even had the belief that I would never have much money because my family didn’t have money.\n\n\"All these beliefs came from just one belief – a belief in a lack of money.\n\n\"So, in 2004, while researching for The Secret film, I created many different money practices and invented lots of imaginary money games in order to change my belief in a lack of money to a belief in an abundance of money. I committed to these practices, and did them every day. And today, there is no lack in my life whatsoever.\n\n\"The Secret team has taken my life-changing money practices that took me from lack to abundance and put them into The Secret to Money App. The App is simple, practical, and designed to radically change the circumstances of money in your life, as it did for me.\"\n\nAvailable in English, Spanish, German, French, Japanese, Korean, Hindi and Mandarin.",

Play 40 different levels, and build bridges over deep valleys, canals, and rivers. Stress tests reveal whether the bridge you build can withstand the daily stress of continual use from cars, trucks and, more recently, super-heavy tank trucks.\n\nYou can choose from a range of materials for each individual bridge, such as wood, steel, cables, or concrete pillars. Use the appropriate materials and stay within budget to build the perfect bridge. The choice of different materials means that there are numerous solutions and approaches and you can build each bridge in any number of ways – your budget is the only limit. The refined grid system allows you to realise your idea of the perfect bridge with even more precision. Let your imagination and creativity run free! And if you happen to run into a dead end, you can pick up valuable tips from the brand new help system! \n\nAwesome Add-Ons: SlopeMania & Trains\n\nIn the SlopeMania add-on you find yourself on the Tiltin Islands, home to three brand new islands where you'll even be building your bridges inside colorful grottoes! The 24 tricky, never-before-seen levels will have you using sloping lanes to overcome the massive height differences.

Tune your harmonium such as the great singer masters where doing, in the indian harmonic scale. You select harmonic scale, and the base note. That's it. \n\nIf you prefer to play western music, religious music, then tune the harmonium to the common tempered scale. You'll have a big church harmonium in your pocket!\n\nOur harmonium can do automatic transposition. You can play in any key with the same keyboard position. You just need to select the note to play on the C key of the keyboard.\n\nHarmonium contains two sound flavours : \n- Traditional Harmonium, with deep sound of original reeds\n- Modern flute organ, simpler, heavenly \n\nEach sound flavour has a simple set of reeds, or double (with octave).\n\nThe harmonium can be tuned between A 380 Hz and 470 Hz.\nAn option enables harmonium to play while your iPhone / iPad is playing music. This is very convenient for training yourself to accompagny your prefered artists! Play karaoke with your harmonium!\n\nFor getting the best sound from this instrument, it is advised to use a good headphone or a pair of speakers with loudspeaker.\n\nWe should distinguish Harmonium from Shruti (or sruti). Actually, the harmonium is a melody instrument and is usually used to follow the melody played by the soloist (sitar, bansuri, vocal, tabla, ...). The Shruti is only used to play continuously a set of notes (drone) for create the musical atmosphere.",

    "description": "OSHO Reminding Yourself of the Forgotten Language of Talking to Your BodyMind.\n\nThis is a guided process allowing you to make friends with your body. A voice will guide you into communicating with your body and with your mind to support natural healing and harmony.\n\nThis process is especially developed as:\n¬ a simple, yet powerful relaxation process for relieving the symptoms of stress-related physical discomforts and pain -- including such as headaches, sleeplessness, digestive problems, neck, and shoulder pain and many other body symptoms.\n\n¬ a method for deepening and harmonizing the body-mind connection, which results in an overall improvement in well-being.\n\n¬ a process of befriending the body and becoming more sensitive to its needs, which in turn can help to support other health-related programs such as diet and exercise.\n\n¬ an initial 7-day process which can be repeated but also used on a daily base according to your own structure.\n\nThe roots of this simple technique can be found in the ancient teachings of China and Tibet. Now, these ancient techniques have been revitalized and updated for the twenty-first century according to the guidance of Osho.\n\nThis guided process is a way of reminding us of a language most of us have forgotten. It's the language of communicating with our own body. To communicate with the body, talking to it, listening to its messages has been a well-known practice in ancient Tibet.\n\nModern medical science is only now beginning to recognize what the sages and mystics have always known: that the mind and body are not separate entities but deeply related. The mind can affect the body, just as the body can affect the mind. Osho has created many meditation techniques especially for today's men and women. This guided meditation of talking to the mind and body has been developed with his guidance.\n\nAbout this, Osho explains: \n\n“Once you start communicating with your body, things become very easy. \n\n“The body need not be forced, it can be persuaded. One need not fight with the body – that's ugly, violent, aggressive, and any sort of conflict is going to create more and more tension. So you need not be in any conflict -- let comfort be the rule. And the body is such a beautiful gift from existence that to fight with it, is to deny existence itself. It is a shrine... we are enshrined in it; it is a temple. We exist in it and we have to take every care of it – it is our responsibility. \n\n“So for seven days.... It will look a little absurd in the beginning because we have never been taught to talk to our own body – and miracles can happen through it. They are already happening without our knowing it. When I am saying something to you, my hand follows in a gesture. I am talking to you – it is my mind that is communicating something to you. My body is following it. The body is en rapport with the mind. \n\n“When you want to raise the hand, you have to do nothing – you simply raise it. Just the very idea that you want to raise it and the body follows it; it is a miracle. In fact biology or physiology has not yet been able to explain how it happens. Because an idea is an idea; you want to raise your hand – it is an idea. How does this idea become transformed into a physical message to the hand? And it does not take any time at all – in a split second; sometimes without any time gap. \n\n“For example, I am talking to you and my hand will go on collaborating; there is no time gap. It is as if the body is running parallel to the mind. It is very sensitive – one should learn how to talk to it, and many things can be done.” Osho\n\n\nApp Features:\n\n- Guided relaxations\n- Journaling for your thoughts as you meditate\n- Reminders\n- High-quality audio files\n- Available in English, Italian, Spanish, Greek, German, Chinese Traditional , Russian, French, Dutch, Hindi, Japanese, Portugues, Turkish, Hebrew, Korean, Svenska, Estonian",

Ideally place the speakers at least 3 to 4 feet away for the best effect.\n\nThis version contains several digitized tanpura profiles. Use them and adjust the tempo/pluck-style to get the best combination that suits your taste. Two full octaves are now supported. Use the higher pitches with caution as they may sound  little shrill and are suitable for use only with instruments.\n\n * About Bheema Tanpura  *\n\n\"This application takes its name from one of the greatest hindustani classical singers of our times, Pt Bhimsen Joshi, the maestro of Kiraana School of North-Indian classical music. He has been an inspiration for me and I belong to his school of Music; this software is a tribute to that great personality\"\n\n\nEnjoy the Naada of your new pair of tanpuras\nMukunda",

This was inspired by TrueCrypt and makes brute force attacks longer. The app itself does not store any hint to the actual cipher, key size or cipher mode of operation.\n• Uses a randomly generated 'salt' combined with the Master password. Salt helps to protect from off-line dictionary attacks.\n• The key to open the data file is created by combining your master password with the 512-bit 'salt'. The result is hashed 1000 times by SHA-256. Repetitive hashing makes a brute force attack more difficult.\n• Supports auto destruction of the data file after a predefined number of unsuccessful unlocks have been tried.\n\nFor more info see http://www.awallet.org/\n\nIf you like this App, rate it in the App Store.

    "description": "Meditation for Busy People offers simple strategies to reduce tension, minimize chronic stress, and quickly relax and unwind. Nobody needs meditation more than people who have no time to meditate. \n\nThese busy people may have tried meditation but given it up, as it seems so difficult to integrate into a hectic lifestyle. Most traditional meditation techniques were developed thousands of years ago for people living a very different lifestyle than today. \n\nFew people today find it easy to just sit down and relax.  \nMeditation for Busy People is filled with methods that can actually be integrated into everyday life. A morning commute becomes a centering exercise, and the street noises outside an apartment window in the city become an aid rather than a distraction to finding the silent space within. \n\nBoth active and passive meditation techniques are covered, and the aim of all the techniques is to teach the practitioner how to find the stillness in the storm of everyday life. Many methods are specially designed to be integrated into the reader's everyday routines, so that they soon can tackle even the most hectic day with an attitude of relaxed calm and playfulness.\n\nApp Features:\n\n• 21 Insights in Osho's voice\n• 21 Practical meditations that can be done on the go!\n• Make notes and easily share your meditations with friends\n• Can be used off-line\n• Retina support\n\nThank you for continued feedback; please email mobile@osho.net so we can continue improving. If you enjoy the app please leave us a store rating.\n\nABOUT OSHO\n\nOsho is a contemporary mystic whose life and teachings have influenced millions of people of all ages, and from all walks of life.  His often provocative and challenging teachings generate today more and more interest and his readership is dramatically expanding around the world in more than fifty languages. People can easily recognize the wisdom of his insights, and their relevance to our lives and to the issues we are facing today.  The Sunday Times in London named Osho as one of the \"1,000 Makers of the 20th Century\". He is known around the world for his revolutionary contribution to meditation – the science of inner transformation – with the unique approach of his \"OSHO Active Meditations\" acknowledging the accelerated pace of contemporary life and bringing meditation into modern life.",

    "description": "Squeezy has helped thousands of women regain confidence in their pelvic floor. Pelvic health specialists around the world recommend Squeezy to their patients every day because it works.\n\nAround 30,000 people use Squeezy regularly to help them remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises. So if you are thinking about downloading Squeezy for your pelvic floor, you are not alone. \n\nAll women should be doing these exercises and some will be doing them as part of a physiotherapy programme.\n\nSqueezy is simple to use, informative and designed to help women to remember to do their pelvic floor muscle exercises (also known as Kegel exercises). \n\nFeatures includes:\n• A pre-set exercise plan that follows public health guidelines\n• A record of the number of exercises you have completed, compared to your target\n• Visual and audio guides for exercises\n• Exercise reminders with customisable settings\n• Educational information about the pelvic floor\n• “Professional mode” – if working with a pelvic health specialist, you can tailor the exercise plan to fit your needs\n• A bladder diary to keep track of your symptoms, if required\n• Simple and clear interface\n\nSqueezy has been clinically reviewed and approved by the NHS for its clinical safety, and is compliant with NHS Information Governance requirements.\n\nSqueezy won several industry awards including ehi Awards 2016, Health Innovation Network 2016, National Continence Care Awards 2015/16 and was a finalist for awards including Advancing Healthcare Awards 2014 and 2017, Abbvie Sustainable Healthcare Awards 2016.\n\nFor more about Squeezy and additional pelvic health information visit squeezyapp.com.\n\n*Apple Watch users*\nDuring your exercises you need to hold your finger on your Apple Watch face to keep it live and running. The play button changes to state ‘Hold’ when running an exercise.\n\nThis keeps your Watch from dozing off while your attention is focused on your pelvic floor. Most Watch screens go to sleep after 7 or 15 seconds (time dependent on your Watch settings). Squeezy has no control over the screen sleep time on the Watch; it has to obey your Watch settings. \n\nWe hope to be able to improve the Watch experience in future. In the meantime, we’re continuing the existing Watch support because many people find it helpful.\n\nIf you have feedback on the Apple Watch, please get in touch with the developers directly on help@squeezyapp.com.\n\n\nThis app has been translated into Saudi Arabian Arabic.\nتمت ترجمه هذا التطبيق الى اللغه العربيه ( المملكه العربيه السعوديه)‏",

    "description": "OSHO Bardo is a meditation, and the metaphysical dying or ‘letting go’ that happens when we move into meditation is similar in many ways to physical death. Meditation is a way to rehearse – and so become more at ease with – the process of dying before it actually happens. \n\nTo benefit from OSHO Bardo you don’t need to wait for the final moments of death; regularly practicing the process can create this freedom in your life and at the same time dispel the fear of death. \n\nIn dying, as in meditating, we can... \n\n⁕ Shift from the outer world to the inner \n⁕ Relax, letting go of all tension \n⁕ Move from doing to being   \n⁕ Let go of all the various roles with which we have been identified \n  ⁕ Enter our own journey, however many other people might be around us  \n\nOSHO Bardo can be used by anyone, of any or no religious or spiritual affiliation. It is for: \n\n⁕ Anyone who would like to live and die consciously\n  ⁕ Anyone who would like to be able to relax while remaining present and alert \n⁕ Anyone who has a fear around living or dying \n⁕ Those already familiar with meditation as well as those who would like to learn how to meditate \n⁕ Carers of those who are ill or dying \n\nThe term BARDO means ‘a transitional time’ and, as such, it offers a heightened potential for inner transformation. The original Bardo Thödol was an ancient method used in Tibet to support the transition of dying.\n\nOsho has asked that a new, more contemporary version be created which supports people who want to die consciously and in a spirit of celebration. OSHO Bardo can be used as a regular meditation to help us to relax and know more awareness and joy in our everyday lives. It is also a preparation for the crescendo of life and the greatest experience of letting go that we will encounter – letting go of life itself.\n\nOver two thousand years ago Tibetan Buddhists created a practice of dying and being reborn. Central to this is the scripture called the Bardo Thödol – Liberation in the Intermediate State through Hearing (aka The Tibetan Book of the Dead). The term, ‘bardo’,’means ‘a transitional time’ and as such it is a time of a heightened potential for inner transformation. Meditation is used as a method to enter this ‘Intermediate State’ consciously and so become free of attachments. \n\nOsho praises the Bardo Thödol as Tibet’s most valuable contribution to the world. However, he also says that a more contemporary version of the Bardo, or a process like it, is needed. \n\nThe Bardo Thödol was created for a specific time, culture, and religion and for people for whom the practice of meditation was intrinsic to daily living. \n\nOsho’s vision is global, encompassing the diversity of those who are new to meditation as well as contemporary and even future meditators. This is reflected in the text of OSHO Bardo, with its easily understandable suggestions that are free of any cultural or religious references. \n\n* Available in English, 中文, Dansk, Ελληνικά, हिन्दी, Italiano, Español, 日本語, Русский & Nederlands language.\n\n\nABOUT OSHO\n\nOsho is a contemporary mystic whose life and teachings have influenced millions of people of all ages, and from all walks of life.  His often provocative and challenging teachings generate today more and more interest and his readership is dramatically expanding around the world in more than fifty languages. People can easily recognize the wisdom of his insights, and their relevance to our lives and to the issues we are facing today.  \n\nThe Sunday Times in London named Osho as one of the \"1,000 Makers of the 20th Century\". He is known around the world for his revolutionary contribution to meditation – the science of inner transformation – with the unique approach of his \"OSHO Active Meditations\" acknowledging the accelerated pace of contemporary life and bringing meditation into modern life.",

Or stick to the streets?\nIt's up to you to guide this poor kitty! \n\n*Supported languages : English, Japanese, Korean, French, Turkish, Polish\n*Language updated: Portuguese, Spanish,  Russian,  has been added. (Please understand, that google translator was the best we could do.)\n\n\n[Frequently asked questions]\n\nQ)Why is this game so SAD?!\nIsn’t the game supposed to be fun and cute? \nthis game is so traumatizing.\nA)This game contains the reality of the street cat’s life.\nOf course, the content of the game is somewhat rough or sad. \nAnd we understand your feeling coming from that. \nbut we don’t have any plan to change the game or ease the violence because there's a message we wanted to send through this game. \nwe made this game because we love cats, not because we hate them. \nI hope that you understand that there are such aspects of the street cat’s life.   \n\nThank you. \n\n\nQ)I always get sad endings, how do I get happy endings? \nA) Instead of ending ‘solitude’ and 'rainbow bridge’. (Ending 5,6)\nThe endings can be seen by achieving an intimacy level 7 with a specific NPC(characters). \nHowever, you can only see one ending at a time, \nso if you target one character at a time, you’ll get the ending you want!\n\n\nQ)There’s only to ‘drop' or ‘eat’ with the item, how do I pick up and give it to the NPC?\nA) If you saw the option to eat or drop. \nit means you already picked up an item. \ntalk to the characters and select 'give present' while holding an item.\n\nQ)The cat is too slow and the hunger shrink so fast!\nA) Upgrading the house will help you. \nHunger, HP, movement speed increase each time you upgrade your home.\n\nQ)Where can I get ‘gloves’ and ‘band-aid’?\nA) the gloves and band-aid can be obtained from the store near Doggo. \nAnd they are 50% chance each to get. \n\n\nQ)Why do I have to start all over after the game ends?\nA) If the game’s over, \nWe assumed that you have already finished the game. \nAll the progress will be reset except with a house upgrade. \nAnd we think that it’s going to be strange if Everyone would recognize the kitty \nAfter crossing the rainbow bridge or get adopted by someone. xD\n\n\nThank you very much for your interest and support!",

    "description": "Turn-by-turn navigation on your bikes dashboard has been introduced for the KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S and R (MY 18,19 &20), the KTM 790 ADVENTURE (MY19 &20), the KTM 390 ADVENTURE (MY20) as well as KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE GT (MY19 & 20) & KTM 1290 SUPER DUKE R (MY20) (Owners of 2017 KTM 1290 SUPER ADVENTURE S & R can also benefit by having the cost-free software upgrade installed and activated at an official KTM dealer.).\n\nConnecting a Bluetooth-enabled Smartphone means more than just co-ordinates and directions. Trips and routes can be saved and loaded for repeat use to allow for forward-planning, and an offline mode means a specific map can be downloaded and used without consuming mobile data in roaming. KTM dealers and the network for servicing and assistance come as custom icons on the map.\n\nSimply negotiate the ‘pairing’ process to make the phone and the bike ‘talk’ to each other and the information can then be relayed. The App transmits turn-by-turn guidance, the distance to the next navigation point, the street name and the arrival time/distance to the destination. In addition, audio guidance in various languages and offline maps are also available.\n\nKTM MY RIDE also allows incoming calls and music, displaying battery life and signal strength. All this data appears on the dash and can be managed with the mode switch, keeping your hands where they belong: on the handlebar.",

Under the watchful eye of the documentary crew, you'll be brewing espresso, steaming and frothing milk, and crafting eye-catching layered drinks for your picky customers.  Work your way through the holidays as you serve seasonal coffee and cannoli, unlock new ingredients, and earn Daily Specials with delicious latte and macchiato recipes.\n\n-- GAME FEATURES --\n\nBREW ESPRESSO AND LAYER DRINKS - Use the Brew Machines to make freshly-brewed shots of espresso, and to steam and froth milk for the customers' drinks.

Complete the drink with toppings, whips, and drizzles for that finishing touch.\n\nCRAFTING CANNOLI - Customers will order a custom-made cannoli along with their Papaccino drinks.
