    "description": "Simple. Reliable. Secure. — WhatsApp from Facebook\n\nWhatsApp Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for iPhone and other smartphones. WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\n\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:\n\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\n\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\n\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp).\n\n• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.\n\n• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.*\n\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book.\n\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out.\n\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \nWe're always excited to hear from you! If you have feedback, questions, or concerns, please email us at:\niphone-support@whatsapp.com\n\nor follow us on twitter:\n\nhttp://twitter.com/WhatsApp\n@WhatsApp\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: WhatsApp is a telephony app, so iPod and iPad are not supported devices.",

Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

    "description": "Rapido, India’s Largest Bike Taxi, is the fastest and the most affordable way for daily commute. Rapido Bike Taxi is available in 90+ cities in India.\n\nWith over 10+ Million happy customers and 50+ Million rides on this app, Rapido is changing the intra-city travel and is providing last-mile connectivity at affordable fares. Having over 1 Million Captains (bike taxi drivers), this bike taxi booking app provides fast transport on bikes, which are easy to wade through other vehicles in the traffic and far more economical than other cab booking apps.\n\nStarted its operations in 2015, Rapido was the first to introduce the concept of bike taxis in India. Over the years, the startup has emerged as a key player in the ride-hailing industry of the country. Unlike its competitors like Ola and Uber, Rapido entirely focuses its operations on the two-wheeler taxi segment, which makes it a pioneer in the two-wheeler taxi sector.\n\nCurrently, Rapido has its presence in 90+ cities that include Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi, NCR, Lucknow, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tiruchirappalli, Indore, Guwahati, Surat, Patna, and Ranchi.\n\nDownload the Rapido Bike Taxi now, and you will never have to wait for the buses in queues or pay the soaring fares of other cab booking apps and shared rides. By offering a quicker, efficient, economical, and trusted option, Rapido stands ahead of other mobility choices in cities like cabs in Hyderabad or cabs in Bangalore.\n\nRapido Bike taxi is also instrumental in reducing traffic congestion and provides a better travel option for solo commuters. Ahead of other cab booking apps, Rapido is by far the most efficient iteration of booking apps for Indian roads. Bikes are obviously a much affordable and inexpensive option for daily commute compared to other online booking options available.\n\nKey features of the Rapido Bike Taxi\nOne-Click Login - No waiting for the OTP for bike booking. For seamless \nonboarding of users, Rapido uses one-click login, which lets them register in a moment\nSave frequently visited locations as Favourites for easier access.\nLive tracking for real-time location of the ride\n\nInsured and Safe Bike Rides\nAt Rapido, the safety of customers is our priority. To ensure that every user is protected, every Rapido ride is insured with Acko Insurance for no extra cost. Furthermore, we provide a helmet and a disposable cap, so you can enjoy the bike taxi ride without having to worry about hygiene. Unlike the self-drive scooter rental options like Bounce and Vogo, Rapido offers you a much-relaxed pillion ride, by taking care of all the safety concerns.\n\nEasy Online Booking App\nBooking a ride through Rapido Bike Taxi App is more convenient than any other scooter rentals, online taxi, or cab apps. With our user-friendly mobile application, you will always have Rapido as your go-to bike booking app!\n\n* Open Rapido Bike Taxi app\n* The App picks your pickup location via GPS, which you can change manually too\n* Enter your destination location. If not, you can also drop a pin on the map to choose the location.\n* Once done, the estimated fare will be displayed on the screen\n* Go ahead and request Rapido to confirm the online booking\n\nEasy Payment Methods\nThough Rapido bike taxi encourages its users to go digital and provide several options to go cashless, customers also have the choice to pay via cash, comfortable with carrying cash. The other digital options that you can choose are wallet systems such as PayTM and Rapido Wallet.",

    "description": "The right way to pay your credit card bills is here.\n\nOn CRED, the idea is simple: pay credit card bills, get rewarded and improve your credit score over time.\n\nUse CRED Coins earned from paying your bills on CRED to win big prizes and unlock access to products at member-exclusive prices, it's that simple.\n\n→ Check & track your credit score with CRED. Download the latest version of CRED to check your credit score now\n\n→ Payment reminders : get credit card bill payment reminders that ensure you never miss your due date and thus get on track to improve your credit score.\n\n→ Hidden charges : automatically detect hidden charges and get alerted on duplicate transactions in your credit card account.\n\n→ Win rewards : win exclusive rewards by using the CRED Coins earned from pay your bills\n\n→ Manage multiple credit cards : make seamless payments from CRED app for all your credit cards.\n\n→ Pay your rent with a credit card : use CRED to make rent payments to your landlord or PG.\n\n→ Spend analysis: complete track of where you spent from your credit card with easy to read spend analysis charts.\n\n\nHow to be a CRED member?\n\n→ CRED is built for rewarding creditworthy individuals in India. To become a CRED member, you need a credit score of 750+.\n\n→ The process is simple → Download CRED → Fill your name, mobile number & email ID → Get a free credit score report\n\n→ If your credit score is 750+, you will get a prompt to verify your credit card details.\n\n→ That's all, you can start paying your credit card bills and earn CRED coins with every payment.\n\n\nWhat is a credit score & what are the basics?\n\n→ The credit score is calculated based on the data that is provided by the lending institutions (typically banks, NBFCs) to the bureaus (typically CRIF, Experian).\n\n→ A credit score indicates your creditworthiness to potential lenders such as banks & mortgage lenders. It indicates how responsible you are likely to be in paying off your loans.\n\n→ Each credit score has a different scale: For example, CRIF has a range of 300-900 while Experian has a range of 300-850.\n\n→ A score of 700+ on CRIF & Experian is considered to be good.\n\n→ A higher credit score is an indicator of good financial behaviour.\n\n\nHow to monitor credit score using CRED?\n\n→ Download the CRED app & signup using your full name and mobile number to get your first credit score result on CRED.\n\n→ Keep making credit card bill payments on CRED to get CRED coins.\n\n→ Use the CRED coins to refresh your credit score every month. Also, receive personalised insights that help you improve your credit score with time.\n\n\nWhat all credit scores are shown on CRED?\n\nThere are 4 credit bureaus in India - Experian, Equifax, CRIF and CIBIL. CRED can showcase your CRIF, Experian and Equifax credit scores and helps track these credit scores individually.\n\n\nWhat all credit cards are supported on CRED?\n\nSBI, HDFC, Axis, Kotak, Standard chartered, American express, Yes bank, HSBC, IndusInd, RBL, Bank of Baroda, Kotak Mahindra, Bank of India plus all VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit cards.\n\n\nWill using a credit card hurt my credit score?\n\nAs long as you make credit card bill payments within the \"grace period\" of 25-30 days, you don't have to pay extra. If you go longer, though, you'll have to pay interest — a percentage of the money you owe — on top of what you borrowed. Defaulting on your credit card payments could negatively hurt your credit score, so make sure you make the credit card bill payments on time.\n\n\nWill using CRED help improve my credit score?\n\nCRED will help you make bill payments on time by reminding you and getting your personalised insights on your financial habits to help you improve your credit score over time. If you apply the actionable insights, yes, you'll be able to improve your credit score like millions of other members.",

    "description": "With 30 billion matches to date, Tinder® is the world’s most popular app for meeting new people. Think of us as your most dependable wingmate — wherever you go, we’ll be there. If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, come on over.\n\nMORE FEATURES? THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you. Think of it as your personal Tinder concierge — available 24/7 — bringing all of your pending matches to you. Now you can sit back, enjoy a fine cocktail and browse through profiles in your own time. Goodbye search fatigue. Hello #GoldLife\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nIf you choose to purchase Tinder Plus or Tinder Gold, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period.

    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. \n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day. \n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS, NETWORK \n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\nBumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way. \nBumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends. \nBumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities. \n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME \n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen billions of messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL \n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company) \n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired) \n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times) \n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard) \n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider) \n\n--- \n\nBumble is free to download and use, and that will never change for our main features. However, if you’re looking to get the most from Bumble, you can subscribe to one of our optional subscription products, Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium. \nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app. \n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. \n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable \n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free. \n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions: \nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy \nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

Whether you want to know what time the cook came in, or you want to let the cab enter the premises or to raise a security alert - MyGate is there for you. \nAs a resident, you can use the app only if your community decides to become a part of the MyGate safe community.\n\nFeatures:\n-Invite friends and family: You send an invite through the app. Guest would receive a unique passcode with the invitation through SMS. The guest provides the passcode to the guard at your gate and gets a seamless entry. No need for visitors to step out of the car and enter details in the register! Saves time and is 100% safe.\n\n-Manage daily helps (maid, cook, driver, electrician, plumber, etc.):  You can now hire domestic help after viewing ratings and comments at your fingertips. You can also find out if your maid has come to the apartment but is yet to visit you. \n\n-eIntercom: This feature replaces the traditional wired intercom with a pocket-friendly solution. A simple feature that allows the main gate to get in touch with you no matter where you are. When your visitor is at the gate, first you will get a mobile notification, and in case of no response to the notification, you will get an automated phone call.\n\n-Message to Guard & Security Alert: These features enable you to have a digitised communication with the gate, eliminating the need to reach out for an intercom. e.g: You want to let the security know, if the lift in your apartment is not working etc. 'Security Alert' feature enables you to raise a security alert to guards in case of emergency. \n\n-Pre-approve entries (cabs, delivery & visiting help): You can pre-approve the entry and have a clear track of the expected visitors for the day. You can also reschedule or cancel a pre-approval.\n\n-Community: You can read your notice board, raise complaints, make maintenance payments, connect with your neighbours and get emergency contacts.\n\n-Household: All your household stuff at one place. Quickly add your family members to get them started on MyGate. Use the passcode to access facilities in your community.\n\n-Activity Feed: You’ll never have to go to multiple places to find who entered your house, did that parcel come or when your community pushed an important notice. You can find and search for all the activities here.\n\nSecurity:\n-We are compliant with the proposed public safety act\n-All data flowing in and out of the app is encrypted with 128 bit SSL\n\nPermissions:\nWe know, it can be a little scary to see applications requesting permission to access areas of your device functionality, so we're trying to be as transparent as possible. Here are the key permissions added to this release and how we are using them to enhance your experience. All of these are optional and are only requested if you wish to use a feature which needs permissions:\n-Contacts (optional): To invite friends and relatives to your home\n-Notifications (optional): To notify you of entry exits and important notices from your community\n-Camera & Gallery (optional): To enable users to add their profile photograph. Also to add pictures when you give something to your domestic help or visitors\n\nWelcome to safe and secure MyGate community experience….\n\n          Privacy policy: https://mygate.in/privacy-policy/",
