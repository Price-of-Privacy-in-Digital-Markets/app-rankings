    "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

    "description": "With the goal of reaching out to large numbers of smartphone users the new mAadhaar is released by Unique Identification Authority of India.  The App features an array of Aadhaar services and a personalised section for the Aadhaar holder who can carry their Aadhaar information in form of a soft copy, instead of carrying a physical copy all the time.  \n\nThe key features in mAadhaar:\nMultilingual : In order to ensure the Aadhaar Services are accessible to linguistically diverse residents of India, the menu, button labels and form fields are provided in English as well as in 12 Indian languages (Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu). After installation the user will be prompted to select any of the preferred language.  However the input fields in the forms will accept data entered in English language only.  This is done to help user avoid facing the challenges of typing in regional languages (due to limitation in the mobile keyboards).\n\nUniversality: Resident with or without Aadhaar can install this App in their smart phones. However to avail personalised Aadhaar services the resident will have to register their Aadhaar Profile in the App. \n\nAadhaar Online Services on Mobile: The mAadhaar user can avail the featured services for themselves as well as for any other resident seeking Aadhaar or related help.\nThe functionalities are broadly grouped as :\n\nMain Service Dashboard : Direct access to download Aadhaar, Order an Reprint, Address Update, Download offline eKYC, Show or Scan QR Code, Verify Aadhaar,  Verify mail/email, retrieve UID/EID, Request for Address Validation Letter\n\nRequest Status Services : To help resident check status of various online requests.\n\nMy Aadhaar: This is a personalised section for Aadhaar holder where resident will not have to enter their Aadhaar number to avail Aadhaar services. In addition this section also provides facility for the resident to lock/unlock their Aadhaar or Biometric Authentication.  \n\nAadhaar Locking – Aadhaar holder can lock their UID/Aadhaar number anytime they wish. \nBiometric locking/unlocking secures biometric authentication by locking biometrics data. Once resident enables Biometric Locking system their biometric remains locked till the Aadhaar Holder chose to either unlock it (which is temporary) or Disable the Locking system.\n\nTOTP generation – Time-based One-Time Password is an automatically generated temporary password which can be used instead of SMS based OTP.\n\nUpdate of profile – To updated view of Aadhaar profile data after successful completion of update request.\n\nSharing of QR code and eKYC data by Aadhaar Number holder helps Aadhaar user share their password protected eKYC or QR code for safe and paperless verification.\n\nMulti-profile: Aadhaar holder can include multiple (upto 3) profiles (with same registered mobile number)  in their profile section.\n\nLocate Enrolment Center helps user find nearest Enrolment Center.",

We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started.

    "description": "Rapido, India’s Largest Bike Taxi, is the fastest and the most affordable way for daily commute. Rapido Bike Taxi is available in 90+ cities in India.\n\nWith over 10+ Million happy customers and 50+ Million rides on this app, Rapido is changing the intra-city travel and is providing last-mile connectivity at affordable fares. Having over 1 Million Captains (bike taxi drivers), this bike taxi booking app provides fast transport on bikes, which are easy to wade through other vehicles in the traffic and far more economical than other cab booking apps.\n\nStarted its operations in 2015, Rapido was the first to introduce the concept of bike taxis in India. Over the years, the startup has emerged as a key player in the ride-hailing industry of the country. Unlike its competitors like Ola and Uber, Rapido entirely focuses its operations on the two-wheeler taxi segment, which makes it a pioneer in the two-wheeler taxi sector.\n\nCurrently, Rapido has its presence in 90+ cities that include Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi, NCR, Lucknow, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tiruchirappalli, Indore, Guwahati, Surat, Patna, and Ranchi.\n\nDownload the Rapido Bike Taxi now, and you will never have to wait for the buses in queues or pay the soaring fares of other cab booking apps and shared rides. By offering a quicker, efficient, economical, and trusted option, Rapido stands ahead of other mobility choices in cities like cabs in Hyderabad or cabs in Bangalore.\n\nRapido Bike taxi is also instrumental in reducing traffic congestion and provides a better travel option for solo commuters. Ahead of other cab booking apps, Rapido is by far the most efficient iteration of booking apps for Indian roads. Bikes are obviously a much affordable and inexpensive option for daily commute compared to other online booking options available.\n\nKey features of the Rapido Bike Taxi\nOne-Click Login - No waiting for the OTP for bike booking. For seamless \nonboarding of users, Rapido uses one-click login, which lets them register in a moment\nSave frequently visited locations as Favourites for easier access.\nLive tracking for real-time location of the ride\n\nInsured and Safe Bike Rides\nAt Rapido, the safety of customers is our priority. To ensure that every user is protected, every Rapido ride is insured with Acko Insurance for no extra cost. Furthermore, we provide a helmet and a disposable cap, so you can enjoy the bike taxi ride without having to worry about hygiene. Unlike the self-drive scooter rental options like Bounce and Vogo, Rapido offers you a much-relaxed pillion ride, by taking care of all the safety concerns.\n\nEasy Online Booking App\nBooking a ride through Rapido Bike Taxi App is more convenient than any other scooter rentals, online taxi, or cab apps. With our user-friendly mobile application, you will always have Rapido as your go-to bike booking app!\n\n* Open Rapido Bike Taxi app\n* The App picks your pickup location via GPS, which you can change manually too\n* Enter your destination location. If not, you can also drop a pin on the map to choose the location.\n* Once done, the estimated fare will be displayed on the screen\n* Go ahead and request Rapido to confirm the online booking\n\nEasy Payment Methods\nThough Rapido bike taxi encourages its users to go digital and provide several options to go cashless, customers also have the choice to pay via cash, comfortable with carrying cash. The other digital options that you can choose are wallet systems such as PayTM and Rapido Wallet.",

    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections.\n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS & NETWORK\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes). \nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

You simply have to enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After, you'll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication for work, school, and non-Microsoft accounts. The app provides a second layer of security after your password. When logging in, you'll enter your password, and then you'll be asked for an additional way to prove it's really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the verification code generated by the app.  \n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.",
