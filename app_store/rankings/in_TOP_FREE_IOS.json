    "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

    "description": "Rapido, India’s Largest Bike Taxi, is the fastest and the most affordable way for daily commute. Rapido Bike Taxi is available in 90+ cities in India.\n\nWith over 10+ Million happy customers and 50+ Million rides on this app, Rapido is changing the intra-city travel and is providing last-mile connectivity at affordable fares. Having over 1 Million Captains (bike taxi drivers), this bike taxi booking app provides fast transport on bikes, which are easy to wade through other vehicles in the traffic and far more economical than other cab booking apps.\n\nStarted its operations in 2015, Rapido was the first to introduce the concept of bike taxis in India. Over the years, the startup has emerged as a key player in the ride-hailing industry of the country. Unlike its competitors like Ola and Uber, Rapido entirely focuses its operations on the two-wheeler taxi segment, which makes it a pioneer in the two-wheeler taxi sector.\n\nCurrently, Rapido has its presence in 90+ cities that include Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi, NCR, Lucknow, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tiruchirappalli, Indore, Guwahati, Surat, Patna, and Ranchi.\n\nDownload the Rapido Bike Taxi now, and you will never have to wait for the buses in queues or pay the soaring fares of other cab booking apps and shared rides. By offering a quicker, efficient, economical, and trusted option, Rapido stands ahead of other mobility choices in cities like cabs in Hyderabad or cabs in Bangalore.\n\nRapido Bike taxi is also instrumental in reducing traffic congestion and provides a better travel option for solo commuters. Ahead of other cab booking apps, Rapido is by far the most efficient iteration of booking apps for Indian roads. Bikes are obviously a much affordable and inexpensive option for daily commute compared to other online booking options available.\n\nKey features of the Rapido Bike Taxi\nOne-Click Login - No waiting for the OTP for bike booking. For seamless \nonboarding of users, Rapido uses one-click login, which lets them register in a moment\nSave frequently visited locations as Favourites for easier access.\nLive tracking for real-time location of the ride\n\nInsured and Safe Bike Rides\nAt Rapido, the safety of customers is our priority. To ensure that every user is protected, every Rapido ride is insured with Acko Insurance for no extra cost. Furthermore, we provide a helmet and a disposable cap, so you can enjoy the bike taxi ride without having to worry about hygiene. Unlike the self-drive scooter rental options like Bounce and Vogo, Rapido offers you a much-relaxed pillion ride, by taking care of all the safety concerns.\n\nEasy Online Booking App\nBooking a ride through Rapido Bike Taxi App is more convenient than any other scooter rentals, online taxi, or cab apps. With our user-friendly mobile application, you will always have Rapido as your go-to bike booking app!\n\n* Open Rapido Bike Taxi app\n* The App picks your pickup location via GPS, which you can change manually too\n* Enter your destination location. If not, you can also drop a pin on the map to choose the location.\n* Once done, the estimated fare will be displayed on the screen\n* Go ahead and request Rapido to confirm the online booking\n\nEasy Payment Methods\nThough Rapido bike taxi encourages its users to go digital and provide several options to go cashless, customers also have the choice to pay via cash, comfortable with carrying cash. The other digital options that you can choose are wallet systems such as PayTM and Rapido Wallet.",

    "description": "With 30 billion matches to date, Tinder® is the world’s most popular app for meeting new people. Think of us as your most dependable wingmate — wherever you go, we’ll be there. If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, come on over.\n\nMORE FEATURES? THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you. Think of it as your personal Tinder concierge — available 24/7 — bringing all of your pending matches to you. Now you can sit back, enjoy a fine cocktail and browse through profiles in your own time. Goodbye search fatigue.
