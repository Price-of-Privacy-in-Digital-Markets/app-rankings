    "description": "Simple. Reliable. Secure. — WhatsApp from Facebook\n\nWhatsApp Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for iPhone and other smartphones. WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\n\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:\n\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\n\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\n\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp).\n\n• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.\n\n• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.*\n\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book.\n\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out.\n\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \nWe're always excited to hear from you! If you have feedback, questions, or concerns, please email us at:\niphone-support@whatsapp.com\n\nor follow us on twitter:\n\nhttp://twitter.com/WhatsApp\n@WhatsApp\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: WhatsApp is a telephony app, so iPod and iPad are not supported devices.",

    "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. Over 400 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your devices at once. Start typing on your phone and finish the message from your tablet or laptop. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it.\n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange.\n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats for up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.), and even set up bots for specific tasks. It's the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages in the minimum bytes possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we are taking great care to keep the interface clean. With its minimalist design, Telegram is lean and easy to use.\n\n100% FREE & NO ADS: Telegram is free and will always be free. We are not going to sell ads or introduce subscription fees. \n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give third parties access to your data.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use end-to-end encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

    "description": "Classroom is a free service for schools, non-profit organisations and anyone with a personal Google account. Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect – inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate and stay organised.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect and mark assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features such as the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organised.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and marks directly in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them directly using their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and mark the assignment – at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join. It takes just minutes to set up.\n\nSaves time\nThe simple, paperless assignment workflow allows teachers to create, review and mark assignments quickly, all in one place.\n\nImproves organisation\nStudents can see all of their assignments on an assignments page, while all class materials (e.g. documents, photos and videos) are automatically filed into folders in Google Drive.\n\nEnhances communication\nClassroom allows teachers to send announcements and start class discussions instantly. Students can share resources with one another or provide answers to questions on the stream.\n\nAffordable and secure\nLike the rest of G Suite for Education services, Classroom contains no ads, never uses your content or student data for advertising purposes, and is free.\n\nPermissions note:\nCamera: Needed to allow the user to take photos or videos and post them to Classroom.\nMicrophone: Needed to enable audio capture for recording videos to be posted to Classroom.\nPhotos: Needed to allow the user to attach photos or videos to Classroom. Photos or videos posted to Classroom will be stored on Google servers in order to show them in Classroom.",

    "description": "With 30 billion matches to date, Tinder® is the world’s most popular app for meeting new people. Think of us as your most dependable wingmate — wherever you go, we’ll be there. If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world. Don’t be shy, come on over.\n\nMORE FEATURES? THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you. Think of it as your personal Tinder concierge — available 24/7 — bringing all of your pending matches to you. Now you can sit back, enjoy a fine cocktail and browse through profiles in your own time.

    "description": "Security and convenience go hand in hand with MyGate. Whether you want to know what time the cook came in, or you want to let the cab enter the premises or to raise a security alert - MyGate is there for you. \nAs a resident, you can use the app only if your community decides to become a part of the MyGate safe community.\n\nFeatures:\n-Invite friends and family: You send an invite through the app. Guest would receive a unique passcode with the invitation through SMS. The guest provides the passcode to the guard at your gate and gets a seamless entry. No need for visitors to step out of the car and enter details in the register! Saves time and is 100% safe.\n\n-Manage daily helps (maid, cook, driver, electrician, plumber, etc.):  You can now hire domestic help after viewing ratings and comments at your fingertips. You can also find out if your maid has come to the apartment but is yet to visit you. \n\n-eIntercom: This feature replaces the traditional wired intercom with a pocket-friendly solution. A simple feature that allows the main gate to get in touch with you no matter where you are. When your visitor is at the gate, first you will get a mobile notification, and in case of no response to the notification, you will get an automated phone call.\n\n-Message to Guard & Security Alert: These features enable you to have a digitised communication with the gate, eliminating the need to reach out for an intercom. e.g: You want to let the security know, if the lift in your apartment is not working etc. 'Security Alert' feature enables you to raise a security alert to guards in case of emergency. \n\n-Pre-approve entries (cabs, delivery & visiting help): You can pre-approve the entry and have a clear track of the expected visitors for the day. You can also reschedule or cancel a pre-approval.\n\n-Community: You can read your notice board, raise complaints, make maintenance payments, connect with your neighbours and get emergency contacts.\n\n-Household: All your household stuff at one place. Quickly add your family members to get them started on MyGate. Use the passcode to access facilities in your community.\n\n-Activity Feed: You’ll never have to go to multiple places to find who entered your house, did that parcel come or when your community pushed an important notice. You can find and search for all the activities here.\n\nSecurity:\n-We are compliant with the proposed public safety act\n-All data flowing in and out of the app is encrypted with 128 bit SSL\n\nPermissions:\nWe know, it can be a little scary to see applications requesting permission to access areas of your device functionality, so we're trying to be as transparent as possible. Here are the key permissions added to this release and how we are using them to enhance your experience. All of these are optional and are only requested if you wish to use a feature which needs permissions:\n-Contacts (optional): To invite friends and relatives to your home\n-Notifications (optional): To notify you of entry exits and important notices from your community\n-Camera & Gallery (optional): To enable users to add their profile photograph. Also to add pictures when you give something to your domestic help or visitors\n\nWelcome to safe and secure MyGate community experience….\n\n          Privacy policy: https://mygate.in/privacy-policy/",

    "description": "Rapido, India’s Largest Bike Taxi, is the fastest and the most affordable way for daily commute. Rapido Bike Taxi is available in 90+ cities in India.\n\nWith over 10+ Million happy customers and 50+ Million rides on this app, Rapido is changing the intra-city travel and is providing last-mile connectivity at affordable fares. Having over 1 Million Captains (bike taxi drivers), this bike taxi booking app provides fast transport on bikes, which are easy to wade through other vehicles in the traffic and far more economical than other cab booking apps.\n\nStarted its operations in 2015, Rapido was the first to introduce the concept of bike taxis in India. Over the years, the startup has emerged as a key player in the ride-hailing industry of the country. Unlike its competitors like Ola and Uber, Rapido entirely focuses its operations on the two-wheeler taxi segment, which makes it a pioneer in the two-wheeler taxi sector.\n\nCurrently, Rapido has its presence in 90+ cities that include Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi, NCR, Lucknow, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tiruchirappalli, Indore, Guwahati, Surat, Patna, and Ranchi.\n\nDownload the Rapido Bike Taxi now, and you will never have to wait for the buses in queues or pay the soaring fares of other cab booking apps and shared rides. By offering a quicker, efficient, economical, and trusted option, Rapido stands ahead of other mobility choices in cities like cabs in Hyderabad or cabs in Bangalore.\n\nRapido Bike taxi is also instrumental in reducing traffic congestion and provides a better travel option for solo commuters. Ahead of other cab booking apps, Rapido is by far the most efficient iteration of booking apps for Indian roads. Bikes are obviously a much affordable and inexpensive option for daily commute compared to other online booking options available.\n\nKey features of the Rapido Bike Taxi\nOne-Click Login - No waiting for the OTP for bike booking. For seamless \nonboarding of users, Rapido uses one-click login, which lets them register in a moment\nSave frequently visited locations as Favourites for easier access.\nLive tracking for real-time location of the ride\n\nInsured and Safe Bike Rides\nAt Rapido, the safety of customers is our priority. To ensure that every user is protected, every Rapido ride is insured with Acko Insurance for no extra cost. Furthermore, we provide a helmet and a disposable cap, so you can enjoy the bike taxi ride without having to worry about hygiene. Unlike the self-drive scooter rental options like Bounce and Vogo, Rapido offers you a much-relaxed pillion ride, by taking care of all the safety concerns.\n\nEasy Online Booking App\nBooking a ride through Rapido Bike Taxi App is more convenient than any other scooter rentals, online taxi, or cab apps. With our user-friendly mobile application, you will always have Rapido as your go-to bike booking app!\n\n* Open Rapido Bike Taxi app\n* The App picks your pickup location via GPS, which you can change manually too\n* Enter your destination location. If not, you can also drop a pin on the map to choose the location.\n* Once done, the estimated fare will be displayed on the screen\n* Go ahead and request Rapido to confirm the online booking\n\nEasy Payment Methods\nThough Rapido bike taxi encourages its users to go digital and provide several options to go cashless, customers also have the choice to pay via cash, comfortable with carrying cash. The other digital options that you can choose are wallet systems such as PayTM and Rapido Wallet.",

You simply have to enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After, you'll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication for work, school, and non-Microsoft accounts. The app provides a second layer of security after your password. When logging in, you'll enter your password, and then you'll be asked for an additional way to prove it's really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the verification code generated by the app.  \n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.",
