    "description": "Pure instant messaging — simple, fast, secure, and synced across all your devices. One of the world's top 10 most downloaded apps with over 500 million active users.\n\nFAST: Telegram is the fastest messaging app on the market, connecting people via a unique, distributed network of data centers around the globe.\n\nSYNCED: You can access your messages from all your phones, tablets and computers at once. Telegram apps are standalone, so you don’t need to keep your phone connected. Start typing on one device and finish the message from another. Never lose your data again.\n\nUNLIMITED: You can send media and files, without any limits on their type and size. Your entire chat history will require no disk space on your device, and will be securely stored in the Telegram cloud for as long as you need it. \n\nSECURE: We made it our mission to provide the best security combined with ease of use. Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

    "description": "With the goal of reaching out to large numbers of smartphone users the new mAadhaar is released by Unique Identification Authority of India.  The App features an array of Aadhaar services and a personalised section for the Aadhaar holder who can carry their Aadhaar information in form of a soft copy, instead of carrying a physical copy all the time.  \n\nThe key features in mAadhaar:\nMultilingual : In order to ensure the Aadhaar Services are accessible to linguistically diverse residents of India, the menu, button labels and form fields are provided in English as well as in 12 Indian languages (Hindi, Assamese, Bengali, Gujarati, Kannada, Malayalam, Marathi, Odia, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu). After installation the user will be prompted to select any of the preferred language.  However the input fields in the forms will accept data entered in English language only.  This is done to help user avoid facing the challenges of typing in regional languages (due to limitation in the mobile keyboards).\n\nUniversality: Resident with or without Aadhaar can install this App in their smart phones. However to avail personalised Aadhaar services the resident will have to register their Aadhaar Profile in the App. \n\nAadhaar Online Services on Mobile: The mAadhaar user can avail the featured services for themselves as well as for any other resident seeking Aadhaar or related help.\nThe functionalities are broadly grouped as :\n\nMain Service Dashboard : Direct access to download Aadhaar, Order an Reprint, Address Update, Download offline eKYC, Show or Scan QR Code, Verify Aadhaar,  Verify mail/email, retrieve UID/EID, Request for Address Validation Letter\n\nRequest Status Services : To help resident check status of various online requests.\n\nMy Aadhaar: This is a personalised section for Aadhaar holder where resident will not have to enter their Aadhaar number to avail Aadhaar services. In addition this section also provides facility for the resident to lock/unlock their Aadhaar or Biometric Authentication.  \n\nAadhaar Locking – Aadhaar holder can lock their UID/Aadhaar number anytime they wish. \nBiometric locking/unlocking secures biometric authentication by locking biometrics data. Once resident enables Biometric Locking system their biometric remains locked till the Aadhaar Holder chose to either unlock it (which is temporary) or Disable the Locking system.\n\nTOTP generation – Time-based One-Time Password is an automatically generated temporary password which can be used instead of SMS based OTP.\n\nUpdate of profile – To updated view of Aadhaar profile data after successful completion of update request.\n\nSharing of QR code and eKYC data by Aadhaar Number holder helps Aadhaar user share their password protected eKYC or QR code for safe and paperless verification.\n\nMulti-profile: Aadhaar holder can include multiple (upto 3) profiles (with same registered mobile number)  in their profile section.\n\nLocate Enrolment Center helps user find nearest Enrolment Center.",

    "description": "The right way to pay your credit card bills is here.\n\nOn CRED, the idea is simple: pay credit card bills, get rewarded and improve your credit score over time.\n\nUse CRED Coins earned from paying your bills on CRED to win big prizes and unlock access to products at member-exclusive prices, it's that simple.\n\n→ Check & track your credit score with CRED. Download the latest version of CRED to check your credit score now\n\n→ Payment reminders : get credit card bill payment reminders that ensure you never miss your due date and thus get on track to improve your credit score.\n\n→ Hidden charges : automatically detect hidden charges and get alerted on duplicate transactions in your credit card account.\n\n→ Win rewards : win exclusive rewards by using the CRED Coins earned from pay your bills\n\n→ Manage multiple credit cards : make seamless payments from CRED app for all your credit cards.\n\n→ Pay your rent with a credit card : use CRED to make rent payments to your landlord or PG.\n\n→ Spend analysis: complete track of where you spent from your credit card with easy to read spend analysis charts.\n\n\nHow to be a CRED member?\n\n→ CRED is built for rewarding creditworthy individuals in India. To become a CRED member, you need a credit score of 750+.\n\n→ The process is simple → Download CRED → Fill your name, mobile number & email ID → Get a free credit score report\n\n→ If your credit score is 750+, you will get a prompt to verify your credit card details.\n\n→ That's all, you can start paying your credit card bills and earn CRED coins with every payment.\n\n\nWhat is a credit score & what are the basics?\n\n→ The credit score is calculated based on the data that is provided by the lending institutions (typically banks, NBFCs) to the bureaus (typically CRIF, Experian).\n\n→ A credit score indicates your creditworthiness to potential lenders such as banks & mortgage lenders. It indicates how responsible you are likely to be in paying off your loans.\n\n→ Each credit score has a different scale: For example, CRIF has a range of 300-900 while Experian has a range of 300-850.\n\n→ A score of 700+ on CRIF & Experian is considered to be good.\n\n→ A higher credit score is an indicator of good financial behaviour.\n\n\nHow to monitor credit score using CRED?\n\n→ Download the CRED app & signup using your full name and mobile number to get your first credit score result on CRED.\n\n→ Keep making credit card bill payments on CRED to get CRED coins.\n\n→ Use the CRED coins to refresh your credit score every month. Also, receive personalised insights that help you improve your credit score with time.\n\n\nWhat all credit scores are shown on CRED?\n\nThere are 4 credit bureaus in India - Experian, Equifax, CRIF and CIBIL. CRED can showcase your CRIF, Experian and Equifax credit scores and helps track these credit scores individually.\n\n\nWhat all credit cards are supported on CRED?\n\nSBI, HDFC, Axis, Kotak, Standard chartered, American express, Yes bank, HSBC, IndusInd, RBL, Bank of Baroda, Kotak Mahindra, Bank of India plus all VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit cards.\n\n\nWill using a credit card hurt my credit score?\n\nAs long as you make credit card bill payments within the \"grace period\" of 25-30 days, you don't have to pay extra. If you go longer, though, you'll have to pay interest — a percentage of the money you owe — on top of what you borrowed. Defaulting on your credit card payments could negatively hurt your credit score, so make sure you make the credit card bill payments on time.\n\n\nWill using CRED help improve my credit score?\n\nCRED will help you make bill payments on time by reminding you and getting your personalised insights on your financial habits to help you improve your credit score over time. If you apply the actionable insights, yes, you'll be able to improve your credit score like millions of other members.",

You simply have to enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After, you'll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication for work, school, and non-Microsoft accounts. The app provides a second layer of security after your password. When logging in, you'll enter your password, and then you'll be asked for an additional way to prove it's really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the verification code generated by the app.  \n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.",
