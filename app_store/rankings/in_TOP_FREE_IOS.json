    "description": "Simple. Reliable. Secure. — WhatsApp from Facebook\n\nWhatsApp Messenger is a FREE messaging app available for iPhone and other smartphones. WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family. Switch from SMS to WhatsApp to send and receive messages, calls, photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\n\nWHY USE WHATSAPP:\n\n• NO FEES: WhatsApp uses your phone's Internet connection (4G/3G/2G/EDGE or Wi-Fi, as available) to let you message and call friends and family, so you don't have to pay for every message or call.* There are no subscription fees to use WhatsApp.\n\n• MULTIMEDIA: Send and receive photos, videos, documents, and Voice Messages.\n\n• FREE CALLS: Call your friends and family for free with WhatsApp Calling, even if they're in another country.* WhatsApp calls use your phone's Internet connection rather than your cellular plan's voice minutes. (Note: Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details. Also, you can't access 911 and other emergency service numbers through WhatsApp).\n\n• GROUP CHAT: Enjoy group chats with your contacts so you can easily stay in touch with your friends or family.\n\n• WHATSAPP WEB: You can also send and receive WhatsApp messages right from your computer's browser.\n\n• NO INTERNATIONAL CHARGES: There's no extra charge to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends around the world and avoid international SMS charges.*\n\n• SAY NO TO USERNAMES AND PINS: Why bother having to remember yet another username or PIN? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS, and integrates seamlessly with your phone's existing address book.\n\n• ALWAYS LOGGED IN: With WhatsApp, you're always logged in so you don't miss messages. No more confusion about whether you're logged in or logged out.\n\n• QUICKLY CONNECT WITH YOUR CONTACTS: Your address book is used to quickly and easily connect you with your contacts who have WhatsApp so there's no need to add hard-to-remember usernames.\n\n• OFFLINE MESSAGES: Even if you miss your notifications or turn off your phone, WhatsApp will save your recent messages until the next time you use the app.\n\n• AND MUCH MORE: Share your location, exchange contacts, set custom wallpapers and notification sounds, broadcast messages to multiple contacts at once, and more!\n\n*Data charges may apply. Contact your provider for details.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \nWe're always excited to hear from you! If you have feedback, questions, or concerns, please email us at:\niphone-support@whatsapp.com\n\nor follow us on twitter:\n\nhttp://twitter.com/WhatsApp\n@WhatsApp\n---------------------------------------------------------\n\nNote: WhatsApp is a telephony app, so iPod and iPad are not supported devices.",

Everything on Telegram, including chats, groups, media, etc. is encrypted using a combination of 256-bit symmetric AES encryption, 2048-bit RSA encryption, and Diffie–Hellman secure key exchange. \n\n100% FREE & OPEN: Telegram has a fully documented and free API for developers, open source apps and verifiable builds to prove the app you download is built from the exact same source code that is published. \n\nPOWERFUL: You can create group chats with up to 200,000 members, share large videos, documents of any type (.DOCX, .MP3, .ZIP, etc.) up to 2 GB each, and even set up bots for specific tasks. Telegram is the perfect tool for hosting online communities and coordinating teamwork.\n\nRELIABLE: Built to deliver your messages using as little data as possible, Telegram is the most reliable messaging system ever made. It works even on the weakest mobile connections. \n\nFUN: Telegram has powerful photo and video editing tools, animated stickers and emoji, fully customizable themes to change the appearance of your app, and an open sticker/GIF platform to cater to all your expressive needs.\n\nSIMPLE: While providing an unprecedented array of features, we take great care to keep the interface clean. Telegram is so simple you already know how to use it.\n\nPRIVATE: We take your privacy seriously and will never give any third parties access to your data. You can delete any message you ever sent or received for both sides, at any time and without a trace. Telegram will never use your data to show you ads.\n\nFor those interested in maximum privacy, Telegram offers Secret Chats. Secret Chat messages can be programmed to self-destruct automatically from both participating devices. This way you can send all types of disappearing content — messages, photos, videos, and even files. Secret Chats use End-to-End Encryption to ensure that a message can only be read by its intended recipient.\n\nWe keep expanding the boundaries of what you can do with a messaging app. Don’t wait years for older messengers to catch up with Telegram — join the revolution today.",

Classroom makes it easy for learners and instructors to connect – inside and outside of schools. Classroom saves time and paper, and makes it easy to create classes, distribute assignments, communicate and stay organised.\n\nClassroom is designed to help teachers create, collect and mark assignments paperlessly, including time-saving features such as the ability to automatically make a copy of a Google document for each student. It also creates Drive folders for each assignment and for each student to help keep everyone organised.\n\nStudents can keep track of what’s due on the Assignments page and begin working with just a click. Teachers can quickly see who has or hasn't completed the work, and provide direct, real-time feedback and marks directly in Classroom.\n\nWith the mobile app for iOS, students and teachers can view their classes and communicate with their classmates in real time. Students can open their assignments and work on them directly using their iPhone or iPad. Teachers can keep track of who has turned in work and mark the assignment – at school or on the go. Students and teachers receive notifications when they have new content in Classroom, so they are always up to date.\n\nThere are many benefits of using Classroom:\n\nEasy to set up\nTeachers can add students directly or share a code with their class to join.

Download the latest version of CRED to check your credit score now\n\n→ Payment reminders : get credit card bill payment reminders that ensure you never miss your due date and thus get on track to improve your credit score.\n\n→ Hidden charges : automatically detect hidden charges and get alerted on duplicate transactions in your credit card account.\n\n→ Win rewards : win exclusive rewards by using the CRED Coins earned from pay your bills\n\n→ Manage multiple credit cards : make seamless payments from CRED app for all your credit cards.\n\n→ Pay your rent with a credit card : use CRED to make rent payments to your landlord or PG.\n\n→ Spend analysis: complete track of where you spent from your credit card with easy to read spend analysis charts.\n\n\nHow to be a CRED member?\n\n→ CRED is built for rewarding creditworthy individuals in India. To become a CRED member, you need a credit score of 750+.\n\n→ The process is simple → Download CRED → Fill your name, mobile number & email ID → Get a free credit score report\n\n→ If your credit score is 750+, you will get a prompt to verify your credit card details.\n\n→ That's all, you can start paying your credit card bills and earn CRED coins with every payment.\n\n\nWhat is a credit score & what are the basics?\n\n→ The credit score is calculated based on the data that is provided by the lending institutions (typically banks, NBFCs) to the bureaus (typically CRIF, Experian).\n\n→ A credit score indicates your creditworthiness to potential lenders such as banks & mortgage lenders. It indicates how responsible you are likely to be in paying off your loans.\n\n→ Each credit score has a different scale: For example, CRIF has a range of 300-900 while Experian has a range of 300-850.\n\n→ A score of 700+ on CRIF & Experian is considered to be good.\n\n→ A higher credit score is an indicator of good financial behaviour.\n\n\nHow to monitor credit score using CRED?\n\n→ Download the CRED app & signup using your full name and mobile number to get your first credit score result on CRED.\n\n→ Keep making credit card bill payments on CRED to get CRED coins.\n\n→ Use the CRED coins to refresh your credit score every month. Also, receive personalised insights that help you improve your credit score with time.\n\n\nWhat all credit scores are shown on CRED?\n\nThere are 4 credit bureaus in India - Experian, Equifax, CRIF and CIBIL. CRED can showcase your CRIF, Experian and Equifax credit scores and helps track these credit scores individually.\n\n\nWhat all credit cards are supported on CRED?\n\nSBI, HDFC, Axis, Kotak, Standard chartered, American express, Yes bank, HSBC, IndusInd, RBL, Bank of Baroda, Kotak Mahindra, Bank of India plus all VISA, MasterCard, American Express and Discover credit cards.\n\n\nWill using a credit card hurt my credit score?\n\nAs long as you make credit card bill payments within the \"grace period\" of 25-30 days, you don't have to pay extra. If you go longer, though, you'll have to pay interest — a percentage of the money you owe — on top of what you borrowed. Defaulting on your credit card payments could negatively hurt your credit score, so make sure you make the credit card bill payments on time.\n\n\nWill using CRED help improve my credit score?\n\nCRED will help you make bill payments on time by reminding you and getting your personalised insights on your financial habits to help you improve your credit score over time. If you apply the actionable insights, yes, you'll be able to improve your credit score like millions of other members.",

Having over 1 Million Captains (bike taxi drivers), this bike taxi booking app provides fast transport on bikes, which are easy to wade through other vehicles in the traffic and far more economical than other cab booking apps.\n\nStarted its operations in 2015, Rapido was the first to introduce the concept of bike taxis in India. Over the years, the startup has emerged as a key player in the ride-hailing industry of the country. Unlike its competitors like Ola and Uber, Rapido entirely focuses its operations on the two-wheeler taxi segment, which makes it a pioneer in the two-wheeler taxi sector.\n\nCurrently, Rapido has its presence in 90+ cities that include Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Chennai, Kolkata, Delhi, NCR, Lucknow, Jaipur, Chandigarh, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Tiruchirappalli, Indore, Guwahati, Surat, Patna, and Ranchi.\n\nDownload the Rapido Bike Taxi now, and you will never have to wait for the buses in queues or pay the soaring fares of other cab booking apps and shared rides. By offering a quicker, efficient, economical, and trusted option, Rapido stands ahead of other mobility choices in cities like cabs in Hyderabad or cabs in Bangalore.\n\nRapido Bike taxi is also instrumental in reducing traffic congestion and provides a better travel option for solo commuters. Ahead of other cab booking apps, Rapido is by far the most efficient iteration of booking apps for Indian roads. Bikes are obviously a much affordable and inexpensive option for daily commute compared to other online booking options available.\n\nKey features of the Rapido Bike Taxi\nOne-Click Login - No waiting for the OTP for bike booking. For seamless \nonboarding of users, Rapido uses one-click login, which lets them register in a moment\nSave frequently visited locations as Favourites for easier access.\nLive tracking for real-time location of the ride\n\nInsured and Safe Bike Rides\nAt Rapido, the safety of customers is our priority. To ensure that every user is protected, every Rapido ride is insured with Acko Insurance for no extra cost. Furthermore, we provide a helmet and a disposable cap, so you can enjoy the bike taxi ride without having to worry about hygiene. Unlike the self-drive scooter rental options like Bounce and Vogo, Rapido offers you a much-relaxed pillion ride, by taking care of all the safety concerns.\n\nEasy Online Booking App\nBooking a ride through Rapido Bike Taxi App is more convenient than any other scooter rentals, online taxi, or cab apps. With our user-friendly mobile application, you will always have Rapido as your go-to bike booking app!\n\n* Open Rapido Bike Taxi app\n* The App picks your pickup location via GPS, which you can change manually too\n* Enter your destination location. If not, you can also drop a pin on the map to choose the location.\n* Once done, the estimated fare will be displayed on the screen\n* Go ahead and request Rapido to confirm the online booking\n\nEasy Payment Methods\nThough Rapido bike taxi encourages its users to go digital and provide several options to go cashless, customers also have the choice to pay via cash, comfortable with carrying cash. The other digital options that you can choose are wallet systems such as PayTM and Rapido Wallet.",

You simply have to enter your username, then approve the notification sent to your phone. Your fingerprint, face ID, or PIN will provide a second layer of security in this two step verification process. After, you'll have access to all your Microsoft products and services, such as Outlook, OneDrive, Office, and more.\n\nMicrosoft Authenticator also supports multi factor authentication for work, school, and non-Microsoft accounts. The app provides a second layer of security after your password. When logging in, you'll enter your password, and then you'll be asked for an additional way to prove it's really you. Either approve the notification sent to the Microsoft Authenticator, or enter the verification code generated by the app.  \n\nSometimes your work or school might ask you to install the Microsoft Authenticator when accessing certain files, emails, or apps. You will need to register your device to your organization through the app and add your work or school account. Microsoft Authenticator also supports cert-based authentication by issuing a certificate on your device. This will let your organization know that the sign-in request is coming from a trusted device and help you seamlessly and securely access additional Microsoft apps and services without needing to log into each. Because Microsoft Authenticator supports single sign-on, once you have proven your identity once, you will not need to log in again to other Microsoft apps on your device.",
