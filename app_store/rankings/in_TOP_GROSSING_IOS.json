We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection.

    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections.\n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS & NETWORK\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes). \nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

    "description": "Ludo King™ is board game played between friends, family & kids.\n\n* A New Quick Ludo Mode available\n* A New Mode MASK MODE available\n* Voice Chat available\n* 5/6 Players online mode available\n\nNew live themes available! Now play with new ludo board.\n\nLudo King is the modern version of the royal game of Parchisi, a game played between Indian kings and queens in ancient times. Roll the dice to play and move your tokens to reach the center of the board. Beat the other players to become the Ludo King. Play this dice game Ludo King. Best casual game in board games.\n\nLudo King follows the traditional rules and the old school look of the Ludo game. The game has evolved throughout the centuries to come to your mobile phone. Just like the kings and queens of India’s golden age, your fate depends on the roll of the dice and your strategy of effectively moving the tokens.\n\nLudo has different names in different regions and countries like Fia, Fia-spel (Fia the game), Le Jeu de Dada (The Game of Dada), Non t'arrabbiare, Fia med knuff (Fia with push), Cờ cá ngựa, Uckers, Griniaris, Petits Chevaux (Little Horses), Ki nevet a végén, برسي (Barjis/Barjees). People also misspell Ludo as Loodo, Lido, Lado, Ledo, Leedo, Laado, or Lodo. \n\nLudo's versions are Trouble, Sorry, Aeroplane chess, Chopat, Chaupur, Pachisi or Parcheesi.\n\nNew Game Themes available:\n•\tChristmas Theme\n•\tNature Theme\n•\tEgypt Theme\n•\tDisco / Night mode Theme\n•\tPinball Theme\n•\tCandy Theme\n•\tChristmas Theme\n•\tPenguin Theme\n•\tBattle Theme\n•\tDiwali Theme\n•\tPirate Theme\n\nFeatures of Ludo King:\n•\tNo internet connection required! Play against the computer.\n•\tPlay with your family and friends through Local and Online Multiplayer.\n•\tPlay with 2 to 6 Players in Local Multiplayer Mode.\n•\tPlay Online Multiplayer Mode in 9 competing game rooms.\n•\tInvite and challenge your Facebook Friends in a Private Game Room and beat them to become Ludo King.\n•\tPlay with world players and make them your buddies.\n•\tPrivate Chat with your Facebook friends & Buddies.\n•\tExpress yourself by sending emojis to your opponents. \n•\tPlay Snake and Ladders on 7 different gameboards.\n•\tSimple rules which can be followed by players of all ages.\n\nPlay the game of Kings with your family and friends. While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. It’s fun for the whole family; You’ll be playing this one for hours. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.\n\nHow to play Ludo King:\nThe objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\n\nAnother nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Like Ludo, you may have played this board game when you were young. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King.\n\nReady to roll the dice?! Make your move and become Ludo King.",

Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type.

Everyone you see in the feed are online and nearby, so get ready for adventure!\n\nWhat makes Pure different:\n\n* Anonymous registration. \nTo create an account you can login with Apple ID. \n* Feed with personal ads.\nTo go online, you need to create and post a personal ad saying what kind of experiences you are looking for. Optionally, you can upload a photo. Upon posting your ad, you’ll see ads from everyone else who’s online, located nearby and ready to go.

They say actions speak louder than words—put your imagination to the test and dazzle your chat partner. \n* Self-destructing photos. \nBurn after seeing! We’ve added self-destructing photos that won’t leak anywhere and will only remain in memories and fantasies\n* We protect your privacy.\nFirst of all, your photos self-destruct upon being seen once. Also, all chat messages, including photos and audio, shared in chats cannot be saved to the phone. If the interlocutor takes a screenshot, an automatic notification will be sent within chat to inform both chat partners.\n* Automatic notifications about potential scam.\nOur system sends automatic alerts on trigger words that might be used by scammers.\nWe strongly recommend  not to give out your phone number or social media accounts! This could lead to abuse or even blackmail. Keep chatting anonymously via Pure and do not switch to other messengers, this will save you from all sorts of troubles. \n\nYou must be at least 18 years old to use Pure.\nPure uses auto-renewing subscriptions — you have to subscribe to get inside. \nHere's what you should know about Pure subscriptions:\n\n- If you choose to purchase a weekly, monthly or annual subscription you'll be able to go online and interact via chats with other users during the chosen subscription period.

You will play as a Commander in the game. Train powerful troops and recruit beautiful female Officers to lead. Unite other Commanders to eliminate the Invaders and finally achieve world peace by establishing a stronger Guild!\r\n\r\n1. Brand New Troop Control System\r\nThe game uses a new free control system that allows players to command multiple troops to march, garrison, and change targets and marching routes on the battlefield. Strong troops cannot prevail without excellent leadership and strategies!\r\n\r\n2. Vivid War Scenes\r\nWe have created vivid cities and battlefields based on actual geography from the late modern Europe, including landmarks that people will recognize. Plus, we have also simulated the famous war machines used during the late modern period, which aim to bringing you back to the era when legends emerged.\r\n\r\n3. Real-time Multiplayer Combat\r\nFighting against real players is always more complicated and appealing than battling the AI. You still need help from other players, even when you're strong because you won't be fighting against one opponent. It could be an entire Guild, or even more.\r\n\r\n4. Multiple Countries to Select\r\nYou can choose different countries to play in the game. Each country has its own Country Trait, and the combat units unique to each country are all famous war machines that served the countries throughout history. You can lead the army that you want in the game, and launch attacks on your enemies!\r\nMillions of players have joined this legendary battlefield. Expand your Guild, show your power, and conquer this land!\r\n\r\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/kissofwaronline/",

Launch yourself between chaos and control as you hit the pedal and roll into underground street racing. Takedown the competition, up your rep, then kick into more races, more customizations, and more cars. Make your choices and never look back.\n\nThis app offers in app purchases. You may disable in app purchases using your device settings.\n\nCUSTOMIZE EXTREME RIDES\nStock your garage with the real-world cars you’ve always wanted, from top manufacturers such as Ferrari, Lamborghini, McLaren, Pagani, Koenigsegg, Hennessey, and more. Then trick them out with the hottest customization system on mobile, from spots like the Mod Shop and the Black Market, giving you over 2.5 million custom combos to play with. Your rides are waiting – take them to the streets to go head-to-head with the competition and prove yourself. \n\nDRIVE FAST – AND FEARLESS \nSteer onto the streets of Blackridge, accelerate over jumps and around debris, into traffic, against walls, and through high-speed Nitro Zones. Flip on the nitrous and thrust yourself into another level of adrenaline-fueled driving and drifting. Around every corner is a fresh race as you clash with local crews and local cops. It’s a world full of wannabe drivers – can you stay in front and earn respect? \n\nRACE TO WIN\nNever back down as you race anyone crazy enough to take you on, leave them gapped, and increase your rep. Dig, drift, drag, and roll your ride to the finish line while outrunning the police on your tail. Burn rubber in over 1,000 challenging races – and that’s just the starting line. Be notorious, own the streets, and score the world’s best cars.
