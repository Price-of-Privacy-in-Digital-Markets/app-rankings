    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. \n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day. \n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS, NETWORK \n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\nBumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way. \nBumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends. \nBumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities. \n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME \n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen billions of messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL \n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company) \n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired) \n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times) \n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard) \n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider) \n\n--- \n\nBumble is free to download and use, and that will never change for our main features. However, if you’re looking to get the most from Bumble, you can subscribe to our optional subscription product Bumble Boost. We offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app. \n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. \n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable \n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free. \n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions: \nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy \nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

And with advanced sharing features, it’s easy to share docs and send files—large or small—to family, friends, and co-workers.\n\nFeatures:\n• Automatically upload videos and photos from your camera roll to cloud photo storage—all in the background—for easy video sharing and photo sharing. \n• Access any file in your account—even offline—and preview over 175 different file types with no special software required.\n• Easily send large files by copying and pasting a link you can give to anyone, even if they don’t have a Dropbox account. \n• Scan documents, receipts, IDs, photos, and more using your mobile device and transform them into high-quality PDFs, so you can view and send anywhere.\n• Sync folders on your PC or Mac to Dropbox with computer backup, and recover older versions or restore deleted files with version history and file recovery. \n\nSign up now for your free Dropbox Plus trial. You’ll get 2 TB (2,000 GB) of storage space—that’s enough room to save files from all your linked devices. We’ve also introduced some new features as part of your Plus plan: Dropbox Passwords to store and sync passwords across all your devices and Dropbox Vault to secure and organize your most sensitive documents. And with Dropbox Rewind, you can roll back any file, folder, or your entire account, up to 30 days.\n\nExisting Plus customers can upgrade to Dropbox Professional. With 3 TB (3,000GB), you can store all your stuff—from work projects to personal photos—and have space to spare. You and your clients can comment on most file types without leaving Dropbox. And you can protect your work with a watermark, add shared link controls, or rewind your account up to 180 days.\n\nBefore starting a trial or completing payment, you’ll see the plan price. This amount will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase and on renewal and will vary by plan and country. Dropbox subscriptions renew monthly or yearly, depending on your plan. Your account will charged for renewal 24 hours before the end of your current billing period. To avoid auto-renewal, turn it off in at least 24 hours before your subscription renews. You can turn off auto-renewal anytime time from your iTunes account settings. You can manage and cancel your subscriptions by going to your account settings on the App Store after purchase.\n\nDropbox is a secure cloud solutions leader trusted by Fortune 500 companies for their most sensitive data. Over 14 million paid users choose Dropbox because they know they can count on a company that’s also dedicated to their security and privacy—no matter what they do or where they are. Let Dropbox be your all-in-one file storage, file organizer, file transfer, and file sharing solution for all your devices.\n\nWe’d love to hear from you!

    "description": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off dating apps. And it’s working. Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html",

    "description": "Ludo King™ is board game played between friends, family & kids.\n\n* A New Mode MASK MODE available\n* Voice Chat available\n* 5/6 Players online mode available\n\nNew live themes available! Now play with new ludo board. Play missions and unlock theme.\n\nLudo King is the modern version of the royal game of Parchisi, a game played between Indian kings and queens in ancient times. Roll the dice to play and move your tokens to reach the center of the board. Beat the other players to become the Ludo King. Play this dice game Ludo King. Best casual game in board games.\n\nLudo King follows the traditional rules and the old school look of the Ludo game. The game has evolved throughout the centuries to come to your mobile phone. Just like the kings and queens of India’s golden age, your fate depends on the roll of the dice and your strategy of effectively moving the tokens.\n\nLudo has different names in different regions and countries like Fia, Fia-spel (Fia the game), Le Jeu de Dada (The Game of Dada), Non t'arrabbiare, Fia med knuff (Fia with push), Cờ cá ngựa, Uckers, Griniaris, Petits Chevaux (Little Horses), Ki nevet a végén, برسي (Barjis/Barjees). People also misspell Ludo as Loodo, Lido, Lado, Ledo, Leedo, Laado, or Lodo. \n\nLudo's versions are Trouble, Sorry, Aeroplane chess, Chopat, Chaupur, Pachisi or Parcheesi.\n\nNew Game Themes available:\n•\tChristmas Theme\n•\tNature Theme\n•\tEgypt Theme\n•\tDisco / Night mode Theme\n•\tPinball Theme\n•\tCandy Theme\n•\tChristmas Theme\n•\tPenguin Theme\n•\tBattle Theme\n•\tDiwali Theme\n\nFeatures of Ludo King:\n•\tNo internet connection required! Play against the computer.\n•\tPlay with your family and friends through Local and Online Multiplayer.\n•\tPlay with 2 to 6 Players in Local Multiplayer Mode.\n•\tPlay Online Multiplayer Mode in 9 competing game rooms.\n•\tInvite and challenge your Facebook Friends in a Private Game Room and beat them to become Ludo King.\n•\tPlay with world players and make them your buddies.\n•\tPrivate Chat with your Facebook friends & Buddies.\n•\tExpress yourself by sending emojis to your opponents. \n•\tPlay Snake and Ladders on 7 different gameboards.\n•\tSimple rules which can be followed by players of all ages.\n\nPlay the game of Kings with your family and friends. While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. It’s fun for the whole family; You’ll be playing this one for hours. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.\n\nHow to play Ludo King:\nThe objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\n\nAnother nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Like Ludo, you may have played this board game when you were young. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King.\n\nReady to roll the dice?! Make your move and become Ludo King.",

We provide end-to-end encryption and automatically delete your chats in 24 hours. \n\nWhat makes Pure different:\n\n* Anonymous registration. \nTo create an account you can login with Apple ID, alternatively you can use your email. \n* Feed with personal ads.\nTo go online, you need to post a personal ad saying what kind of experiences you are looking for on the app. Optionally, you can upload a photo to your ad. Upon posting your ad, you will see a feed with other users around. Everyone you see in the feed is online and ready to chat right now. \n* Self-destructing chats.\nChats are created automatically upon matching someone and all chats self-destruct in 24 hours. However, the timer can be disabled by mutual agreement. \n* We protect your privacy.\nAll chat messages, including photos and audio, shared in chats cannot be saved to the phone. If the interlocutor takes a screenshot, an automatic notification will be sent within chat to inform both chat partners.\n* Automatic notifications about potential scam.\nOur system sends automatic alerts on trigger words that might be used by scammers.\nWe strongly recommend  not to give out your phone number or social media accounts! This could lead to abuse or even blackmail. Keep chatting anonymously via Pure and do not switch to other messengers, this will save you from all sorts of troubles. \n\nYou must be at least 18 years old to use Pure.\nPure uses auto-renewing subscriptions — you have to subscribe to get inside. \nHere's what you should know about Pure subscriptions:\n\n- If you choose to purchase a weekly, monthly or annual subscription you'll be able to go online and interact via chats with other users during the chosen subscription period. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n- All subscriptions renew automatically unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period without any limitations.\n- Auto-renewal can be cancelled at any time in your iTunes subscription settings.\n- All personal data is handled under Pure’s privacy policy https://pure.app/policy/\n- Terms and conditions: https://pure.app/terms/",

    "description": "The cloud-based service for people who love photography, Lightroom gives you everything you need to edit, organize, store, and share your photos across desktop, mobile, and web. \n\n  \n\nCreate incredible photos anywhere with Lightroom and 1TB of cloud storage. The app offers powerful photo editing features in an easy-to-use interface. Adjust your full-resolution shots and have both your originals and edits backed up to the cloud. Organize with searchable keywords that are automatically applied without the hassle of tagging. And easily share and showcase your photos in fun ways. \n\n  \n\nAnywhere editing: \n\n  \n\nWith easy-to-use photo editing tools like sliders and filters, Lightroom makes it simple to create photos that look just the way you want. And you can edit your full-resolution photos anywhere — on mobile devices, the web, or your desktop. Edits on one device are automatically applied everywhere else. \n\n \n\nSmarter organization: \n\nAdobe Sensei uses machine learning to recognize the people and other content in your photos and then applies searchable keywords automatically. Looking for shots of your cousin or favorite trips to the water? Auto-tagging makes searching a snap so you can create albums based on any person or theme you want. \n\nWorry-free storage: \n\nThe 1TBG of cloud storage included with Lightroom ensures that you can access your entire library of full-resolution photos anytime you want, anywhere you are, from any device. \n\nEasy sharing: \n\nShare your photographs with loved ones, clients, or an even bigger audience. Post photos directly to social sites, showcase them on your website by sending them directly to Adobe Portfolio, and create stunning graphics, web pages, and video stories in minutes with Adobe Spark. It's all included in your membership. \n\nLearn from the pros: \n\nExplore in-app Lightroom tutorials, plus inspirational content from professional photographers and educators as they take you through their process, step by step \n\n\nPremium (Optional in-app purchase) The recurring monthly payment is automatically charged to your iTunes account.
