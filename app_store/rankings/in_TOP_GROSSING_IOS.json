    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections.\n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS & NETWORK\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use. However, we also offer optional subscription packages (Bumble Premium and Bumble Boost) and single or multiple-use paid services for which no subscription is required (including Spotlights and SuperSwipes). \nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period.\n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable\n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free.\n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions:\nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy\nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

Play against the computer.\n•\tPlay with your family and friends through Local and Online Multiplayer.\n•\tPlay with 2 to 6 Players in Local Multiplayer Mode.\n•\tPlay Online Multiplayer Mode in 9 competing game rooms.\n•\tInvite and challenge your Facebook Friends in a Private Game Room and beat them to become Ludo King.\n•\tPlay with world players and make them your buddies.\n•\tPrivate Chat with your Facebook friends & Buddies.\n•\tExpress yourself by sending emojis to your opponents. \n•\tPlay Snake and Ladders on 7 different gameboards.\n•\tSimple rules which can be followed by players of all ages.\n\nPlay the game of Kings with your family and friends. While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. It’s fun for the whole family; You’ll be playing this one for hours. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.\n\nHow to play Ludo King:\nThe objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\n\nAnother nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Like Ludo, you may have played this board game when you were young. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King.\n\nReady to roll the dice?! Make your move and become Ludo King.",

    "description": "HINGE, DESIGNED TO BE DELETED\nHinge is the dating app for people who want to get off dating apps. And it’s working. Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation.

    "description": "Kiss of War is a war strategy game set in the late modern period. It tells a story about a group of charming women with different pasts fighting against the Invaders with allies. You will play as a Commander in the game. Train powerful troops and recruit beautiful female Officers to lead. Unite other Commanders to eliminate the Invaders and finally achieve world peace by establishing a stronger Guild!\r\n\r\n1. Brand New Troop Control System\r\nThe game uses a new free control system that allows players to command multiple troops to march, garrison, and change targets and marching routes on the battlefield. Strong troops cannot prevail without excellent leadership and strategies!\r\n\r\n2. Vivid War Scenes\r\nWe have created vivid cities and battlefields based on actual geography from the late modern Europe, including landmarks that people will recognize. Plus, we have also simulated the famous war machines used during the late modern period, which aim to bringing you back to the era when legends emerged.\r\n\r\n3. Real-time Multiplayer Combat\r\nFighting against real players is always more complicated and appealing than battling the AI. You still need help from other players, even when you're strong because you won't be fighting against one opponent. It could be an entire Guild, or even more.\r\n\r\n4. Multiple Countries to Select\r\nYou can choose different countries to play in the game. Each country has its own Country Trait, and the combat units unique to each country are all famous war machines that served the countries throughout history. You can lead the army that you want in the game, and launch attacks on your enemies!\r\nMillions of players have joined this legendary battlefield. Expand your Guild, show your power, and conquer this land!\r\n\r\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/kissofwaronline/",

Everyone you see in the feed are online and nearby, so get ready for adventure!\n\nWhat makes Pure different:\n\n* Anonymous registration. \nTo create an account you can login with Apple ID. \n* Feed with personal ads.\nTo go online, you need to create and post a personal ad saying what kind of experiences you are looking for. Optionally, you can upload a photo. Upon posting your ad, you’ll see ads from everyone else who’s online, located nearby and ready to go. As soon as you go offline, your ad becomes invisible.\n* Self-destructing chats.\nChats are created automatically upon matching someone and all chats self-destruct in 24 hours. However, the timer can be disabled by mutual agreement. \n* Video chats.\nSeeing is believing! Now you can have face to face conversations directly in chat. While using video chats you can ‘wear’ a virtual mask and keep your anonymity. They say actions speak louder than words—put your imagination to the test and dazzle your chat partner. \n* Self-destructing photos. \nBurn after seeing!
