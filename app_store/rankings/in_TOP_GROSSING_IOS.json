    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections. \n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day. \n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS, NETWORK \n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\nBumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way. \nBumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends. \nBumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities. \n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME \n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else, the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen billions of messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL \n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company) \n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired) \n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times) \n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard) \n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider) \n\n--- \n\nBumble is free to download and use, and that will never change for our main features. However, if you’re looking to get the most from Bumble, you can subscribe to one of our optional subscription products, Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium. \nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app. \n\n* Payment will be charged to your iTunes account at confirmation of purchase. \n* Your subscription will automatically renew itself, unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. \n* Your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. \n* You can manage your subscriptions and turn off auto-renewal by going to your Account Settings in the iTunes Store. \n* If offered, if you choose to use our free trial, any unused portion of the free trial period will be forfeited when you purchase a subscription to that publication, where applicable \n* If you don’t choose to purchase Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium, you can simply continue using and enjoying Bumble for free. \n\nYour personal data is securely stored on Bumble - be sure to read our privacy policy and terms and conditions: \nhttps://www.bumble.com/privacy \nhttps://www.bumble.com/terms",

    "description": "Kiss of War is a war strategy game set in the late modern period. It tells a story about a group of charming women with different pasts fighting against the Invaders with allies. You will play as a Commander in the game. Train powerful troops and recruit beautiful female Officers to lead. Unite other Commanders to eliminate the Invaders and finally achieve world peace by establishing a stronger Guild!\r\n\r\n1. Brand New Troop Control System\r\nThe game uses a new free control system that allows players to command multiple troops to march, garrison, and change targets and marching routes on the battlefield. Strong troops cannot prevail without excellent leadership and strategies!\r\n\r\n2. Vivid War Scenes\r\nWe have created vivid cities and battlefields based on actual geography from the late modern Europe, including landmarks that people will recognize. Plus, we have also simulated the famous war machines used during the late modern period, which aim to bringing you back to the era when legends emerged.\r\n\r\n3. Real-time Multiplayer Combat\r\nFighting against real players is always more complicated and appealing than battling the AI. You still need help from other players, even when you're strong because you won't be fighting against one opponent. It could be an entire Guild, or even more.\r\n\r\n4. Multiple Countries to Select\r\nYou can choose different countries to play in the game. Each country has its own Country Trait, and the combat units unique to each country are all famous war machines that served the countries throughout history. You can lead the army that you want in the game, and launch attacks on your enemies!\r\nMillions of players have joined this legendary battlefield. Expand your Guild, show your power, and conquer this land!\r\n\r\nFacebook : https://www.facebook.com/kissofwaronline/",

Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html",

    "description": "Ludo King™ is board game played between friends, family & kids.\n\n* A New Mode MASK MODE available\n* Voice Chat available\n* 5/6 Players online mode available\n\nNew live themes available! Now play with new ludo board. Play missions and unlock theme.\n\nLudo King is the modern version of the royal game of Parchisi, a game played between Indian kings and queens in ancient times. Roll the dice to play and move your tokens to reach the center of the board. Beat the other players to become the Ludo King. Play this dice game Ludo King. Best casual game in board games.\n\nLudo King follows the traditional rules and the old school look of the Ludo game. The game has evolved throughout the centuries to come to your mobile phone. Just like the kings and queens of India’s golden age, your fate depends on the roll of the dice and your strategy of effectively moving the tokens.\n\nLudo has different names in different regions and countries like Fia, Fia-spel (Fia the game), Le Jeu de Dada (The Game of Dada), Non t'arrabbiare, Fia med knuff (Fia with push), Cờ cá ngựa, Uckers, Griniaris, Petits Chevaux (Little Horses), Ki nevet a végén, برسي (Barjis/Barjees). People also misspell Ludo as Loodo, Lido, Lado, Ledo, Leedo, Laado, or Lodo. \n\nLudo's versions are Trouble, Sorry, Aeroplane chess, Chopat, Chaupur, Pachisi or Parcheesi.\n\nNew Game Themes available:\n•\tChristmas Theme\n•\tNature Theme\n•\tEgypt Theme\n•\tDisco / Night mode Theme\n•\tPinball Theme\n•\tCandy Theme\n•\tChristmas Theme\n•\tPenguin Theme\n•\tBattle Theme\n•\tDiwali Theme\n\nFeatures of Ludo King:\n•\tNo internet connection required! Play against the computer.\n•\tPlay with your family and friends through Local and Online Multiplayer.\n•\tPlay with 2 to 6 Players in Local Multiplayer Mode.\n•\tPlay Online Multiplayer Mode in 9 competing game rooms.\n•\tInvite and challenge your Facebook Friends in a Private Game Room and beat them to become Ludo King.\n•\tPlay with world players and make them your buddies.\n•\tPrivate Chat with your Facebook friends & Buddies.\n•\tExpress yourself by sending emojis to your opponents. \n•\tPlay Snake and Ladders on 7 different gameboards.\n•\tSimple rules which can be followed by players of all ages.\n\nPlay the game of Kings with your family and friends. While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. It’s fun for the whole family; You’ll be playing this one for hours. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.\n\nHow to play Ludo King:\nThe objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\n\nAnother nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Like Ludo, you may have played this board game when you were young. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King.\n\nReady to roll the dice?! Make your move and become Ludo King.",

The app offers powerful photo editing features in an easy-to-use interface. Adjust your full-resolution shots and have both your originals and edits backed up to the cloud. Organize with searchable keywords that are automatically applied without the hassle of tagging. And easily share and showcase your photos in fun ways. \n\n  \n\nAnywhere editing: \n\n  \n\nWith easy-to-use photo editing tools like sliders and filters, Lightroom makes it simple to create photos that look just the way you want. And you can edit your full-resolution photos anywhere — on mobile devices, the web, or your desktop. Edits on one device are automatically applied everywhere else. \n\n \n\nSmarter organization: \n\nAdobe Sensei uses machine learning to recognize the people and other content in your photos and then applies searchable keywords automatically. Looking for shots of your cousin or favorite trips to the water? Auto-tagging makes searching a snap so you can create albums based on any person or theme you want. \n\nWorry-free storage: \n\nThe 1TBG of cloud storage included with Lightroom ensures that you can access your entire library of full-resolution photos anytime you want, anywhere you are, from any device. \n\nEasy sharing: \n\nShare your photographs with loved ones, clients, or an even bigger audience. Post photos directly to social sites, showcase them on your website by sending them directly to Adobe Portfolio, and create stunning graphics, web pages, and video stories in minutes with Adobe Spark. It's all included in your membership. \n\nLearn from the pros: \n\nExplore in-app Lightroom tutorials, plus inspirational content from professional photographers and educators as they take you through their process, step by step \n\n\nPremium (Optional in-app purchase) The recurring monthly payment is automatically charged to your iTunes account.
