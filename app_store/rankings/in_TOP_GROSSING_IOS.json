If you’re here to meet new people, expand your social network, meet locals when you’re travelling, or just live in the now, you’ve come to the right place. We’re called “the world’s hottest app” for a reason: we spark more than 26 million matches per day. How many dating apps do that?\n\nMatch. Chat. Date. Tinder is easy and fun — use the Swipe Right™ feature to like someone, use the Swipe Left™ feature to pass. If someone likes you back, it’s a match! We invented the double opt-in so that 2 people will only match when there’s a mutual interest. No stress. No rejection. Just tap through the profiles you’re interested in, chat online with your matches, and then step away from your phone, meet up in the real world and spark something new.\n\nNow, let’s get started. And remember, when in doubt, give a Swipe Right™. Trust us, the more options you have, the better-looking life becomes. \n\nWelcome to Tinder — the largest, hottest community of singles in the world.

THAT’S A PLUS\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Plus® for premium features, including unlimited likes, so you can use the Swipe Right feature to your heart’s content; Passport to chat with singles anywhere around the world; Rewind to give someone a second chance; one free Boost per month to be the top profile in your area for 30 minutes; and additional Super Likes to stand out from the crowd.\n\nGET THE GOLD TREATMENT\n\nUpgrade to Tinder Gold™ for a first-class experience: Passport, Rewind, unlimited likes, five Super Likes per day, one Boost per month, and more profile controls. But wait: it gets better. Save time and aimless searching with our Likes You feature, which lets you see who likes you.

    "description": "Millions of people have signed up for Bumble to start building valuable relationships, finding friends, and making empowered connections.\n\nCreating new connections has never been easier. Bumble is working to lift the stigma of online dating by employing unprecedented standards for respectful behaviour. Because of this relentless dedication, millions of people are using Bumble to build valuable relationships every single day.\n\nDATE, MEET FRIENDS & NETWORK\n\nBumble is at the forefront of matchmaking technology by providing an app that allows users to foster more than just romantic connections. The industry-leading app empowers users to swipe through potential connections across three different modes: \n\n- Bumble Date: On Bumble Date, women make the first move. We’ve changed the archaic rules of the dating game so that you can form meaningful relationships in a respectful way.\n\n- Bumble BFF: Life is better with friends. Whether you’re new to a city or looking to expand your circle, Bumble BFF is the easiest way to make new friends.\n\n- Bumble Bizz: Now we’re in business. Use Bumble Bizz to network, find mentors, and create new career opportunities.\n\n\nBumble is the first app of its kind to bring dating, friend-finding, and career-building into a single social networking platform. \n\nCHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME\n\nAt Bumble, women make the first move. In heterosexual matches, the woman has 24 hours to make the first move and the man has 24 hours to respond. In same-sex matches, either person has 24 hours to make the first move, while the other individual has 24 hours to respond, or else the connection expires. By prompting our users to be bold and make the first move we’ve seen over 3 billion messages sent to date. \n\nTHE BUZZ IS REAL\n\n“Bumble exists to empower women...” (Fast Company)\n“Bumble is just an app: but it’s changing the discussion.” (Wired)\n“Bumble offers an alternative that prioritises meaningful connections, with women calling the shots:” (UK Sunday Times)\n“Bumble rejects hate speech to make users feel safe on its dating app” (Texas Standard)\n“What makes Bumble different from other dating apps...is its focus on giving women all the power. ” (Business Insider)\n\n---\n\nBumble is free to download and use, and that will never change for our main features. However, if you’re looking to get the most from Bumble, you can subscribe to one of our optional subscription products, Bumble Boost or Bumble Premium. \nWe offer weekly, monthly, 3 month and 6 month subscriptions giving discounts to the weekly price. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change without notice.

Currently, 3 out of 4 times Hinge members want to go on a second date, we’re the #1 mobile-first dating app mentioned in the New York Times wedding section, and we’re the fastest growing dating app in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.\n\nHOW WE GET YOU OFF HINGE\nIn today’s digital world, singles are so busy matching that they’re not actually connecting, in person, where it counts. Hinge is on a mission to change that. So we built an app that’s designed to be deleted.\n\n* We quickly learn your type. You’ll only be introduced to the best people for you.\n\n* We give you a sense of someone’s personality. You’ll get to know potential dates through their unique answers to prompts, and personal information like religion, height, and politics.\n\n* We make it easy to start a conversation. Every match begins by someone liking or commenting on a specific part of your profile.\n\n* We ask how your dates are going. After exchanging phone numbers with a Match, we’ll follow up to hear how your date went so we can make better recommendations in the future.\n\nThe app is free to use. Members looking to see who likes them or to set advanced preferences can upgrade to a Preferred Membership.\n\nTHE BUZZ ABOUT HINGE\n“Hinge’s CEO says a good dating app relies on vulnerability, not algorithms.” - Washington Post\n\"Hinge is the first dating app to actually measure real-world success\" - TechCrunch\n“A great option for those fed up with temporary love.” -TheNextWeb\n\nSUBSCRIPTION INFO\nPayment will be charged to iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase\nSubscription automatically renews unless auto-renew is turned off at least 24-hours before the end of the current period\nAccount will be charged for renewal within 24-hours prior to the end of the current period\nSubscriptions may be managed and auto-renewal may be turned off by going to Account Settings after purchase\n\nSupport: hello@hinge.co\nTerms of Service: https://hinge.co/terms.html\nPrivacy Policy: https://hinge.co/privacy.html",

    "description": "Ludo King™ is board game played between friends, family & kids.\n\n* A New Quick Ludo Mode available\n* A New Mode MASK MODE available\n* Voice Chat available\n* 5/6 Players online mode available\n\nNew live themes available! Now play with new ludo board.\n\nLudo King is the modern version of the royal game of Parchisi, a game played between Indian kings and queens in ancient times. Roll the dice to play and move your tokens to reach the center of the board. Beat the other players to become the Ludo King. Play this dice game Ludo King. Best casual game in board games.\n\nLudo King follows the traditional rules and the old school look of the Ludo game. The game has evolved throughout the centuries to come to your mobile phone. Just like the kings and queens of India’s golden age, your fate depends on the roll of the dice and your strategy of effectively moving the tokens.\n\nLudo has different names in different regions and countries like Fia, Fia-spel (Fia the game), Le Jeu de Dada (The Game of Dada), Non t'arrabbiare, Fia med knuff (Fia with push), Cờ cá ngựa, Uckers, Griniaris, Petits Chevaux (Little Horses), Ki nevet a végén, برسي (Barjis/Barjees). People also misspell Ludo as Loodo, Lido, Lado, Ledo, Leedo, Laado, or Lodo. \n\nLudo's versions are Trouble, Sorry, Aeroplane chess, Chopat, Chaupur, Pachisi or Parcheesi.\n\nNew Game Themes available:\n•\tChristmas Theme\n•\tNature Theme\n•\tEgypt Theme\n•\tDisco / Night mode Theme\n•\tPinball Theme\n•\tCandy Theme\n•\tChristmas Theme\n•\tPenguin Theme\n•\tBattle Theme\n•\tDiwali Theme\n\nFeatures of Ludo King:\n•\tNo internet connection required! Play against the computer.\n•\tPlay with your family and friends through Local and Online Multiplayer.\n•\tPlay with 2 to 6 Players in Local Multiplayer Mode.\n•\tPlay Online Multiplayer Mode in 9 competing game rooms.\n•\tInvite and challenge your Facebook Friends in a Private Game Room and beat them to become Ludo King.\n•\tPlay with world players and make them your buddies.\n•\tPrivate Chat with your Facebook friends & Buddies.\n•\tExpress yourself by sending emojis to your opponents. \n•\tPlay Snake and Ladders on 7 different gameboards.\n•\tSimple rules which can be followed by players of all ages.\n\nPlay the game of Kings with your family and friends. While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. It’s fun for the whole family; You’ll be playing this one for hours. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.\n\nHow to play Ludo King:\nThe objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line. Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player’s token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you’ll need to roll a six again.\n\nAnother nostalgic game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders. Like Ludo, you may have played this board game when you were young. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. As the name suggests, the board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King.\n\nReady to roll the dice?! Make your move and become Ludo King.",

Here are some of them:\n \nKegel exercises increase sexual stamina by 253% according to the University of Sapienza study in Rome, Italy. One of the oldest in history and one of the best universities in Europe;\n \nKegel exercises strengthen potency in 75% of men according to the Somerset Nuffield Hospital study in Taunton, Great Britain. Almost the same result (71%) showed another independent study in the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, leading European university in Belgium.\n \nThis method is considered as a first-line approach for men seeking long-term resolution without pharmacological and surgical interventions. \n\nAnd even if you don’t have any issues now, it doesn’t mean you won’t have them in future. Kegel exercises are recommended as a daily practice for men at any age.\n \nThat’s why we’ve packed Kegel exercises into a systematic app. Yet, men’s health includes many factors.

A great variety of different Kegel exercises increase their difficulty as you progress.\n \nPRACTICE CENTER - REFINE YOUR TECHNIQUE\n\nImprove your technique of performing exercises from the Vibro Trainings to increase training efficiency.\n \nKEGEL FITNESS - FOR ADDITIONAL LOAD & FASTER RESULT\n\nPerform special fitness exercises to get additional load on your Pelvic Floor muscles. Increase blood circulation in the groin area and build its strength and flexibility.\n\nKegel Fitness exercises can be performed even by the beginners.The training sessions take as little as 5 minutes , which makes it perfect for those with a busy lifestyle. \n\n\nPROGRESS TRACKER - MONITOR YOUR RESULTS\n \nTake regular measurements.

    "description": "Pure is a shameless dating app where words start a fire, and desires match. The best place for private talks and video chats. Everyone you see in the feed are online and nearby, so get ready for adventure!\n\nWhat makes Pure different:\n\n* Anonymous registration. \nTo create an account you can login with Apple ID. \n* Feed with personal ads.\nTo go online, you need to create and post a personal ad saying what kind of experiences you are looking for. Optionally, you can upload a photo. Upon posting your ad, you’ll see ads from everyone else who’s online, located nearby and ready to go. As soon as you go offline, your ad becomes invisible.\n* Self-destructing chats.\nChats are created automatically upon matching someone and all chats self-destruct in 24 hours. However, the timer can be disabled by mutual agreement. \n* Video chats.\nSeeing is believing! Now you can have face to face conversations directly in chat. While using video chats you can ‘wear’ a virtual mask and keep your anonymity. They say actions speak louder than words—put your imagination to the test and dazzle your chat partner. \n* Self-destructing photos. \nBurn after seeing! We’ve added self-destructing photos that won’t leak anywhere and will only remain in memories and fantasies\n* We protect your privacy.\nFirst of all, your photos self-destruct upon being seen once. Also, all chat messages, including photos and audio, shared in chats cannot be saved to the phone. If the interlocutor takes a screenshot, an automatic notification will be sent within chat to inform both chat partners.\n* Automatic notifications about potential scam.\nOur system sends automatic alerts on trigger words that might be used by scammers.\nWe strongly recommend  not to give out your phone number or social media accounts! This could lead to abuse or even blackmail. Keep chatting anonymously via Pure and do not switch to other messengers, this will save you from all sorts of troubles. \n\nYou must be at least 18 years old to use Pure.\nPure uses auto-renewing subscriptions — you have to subscribe to get inside. \nHere's what you should know about Pure subscriptions:\n\n- If you choose to purchase a weekly, monthly or annual subscription you'll be able to go online and interact via chats with other users during the chosen subscription period. The prices may vary per country and are subject to change with a notice. Prices are clearly displayed in the app.\n- All subscriptions renew automatically unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the current subscription period without any limitations.\n- Auto-renewal can be canceled at any time by going to your settings in the AppStore after the purchase.\n- All personal data is handled under Pure’s privacy policy https://pure.app/policy/\n- Terms and conditions: https://pure.app/terms/",

    "description": "Looking for a way to stay private online? Here it is! With NordVPN, one tap is all you need to hide your IP address, encrypt your traffic, and enjoy the internet without limits.\r\n\nNordVPN is an easy-to-use VPN app for iPhone and iPad, trusted by millions of users worldwide. It shields your online activities from nosy advertisers, malicious actors, and intrusive internet service providers. How? By encrypting your internet traffic.\r\n\nNordVPN is the best way to have a private, fast, and secure internet connection wherever you are.\r\n\r\nWhy NordVPN?\r\n\nTURBO SPEEDS\r\n•\tUse NordLynx, our modern solution based on the WireGuard® protocol, to get VPN connection speeds that are hard to beat.\r\n•\tMore than 5500 remote servers in 59 countries mean that the perfect one is always just a tap away.\r\n•\tTap “Quick Connect,” and you’ll be connected to the best server in seconds!\r\nIDEAL FOR PRIVACY\r\n•\tWe don’t track and store your activity online. Therefore, we can’t give your data away – even if someone asks. And we’ve had two independent audits to prove it!\r\n•\tFound a cozy cafe with a Wi-Fi hotspot, but it’s unsecured?

With almost 60 countries to choose from, you’re sure to find the perfect one.\r\n•\tUnlike a proxy server or the Tor browser, NordVPN goes beyond hiding your IP. It will also encrypt your traffic and maintain a stable connection.\r\n\nSECURITY IS THE PRIORITY\r\n•\tEnable the Dark Web Monitor to get an alert if your credentials are exposed online.\r\n•\tTurn the Kill Switch on to stay safe in case your VPN connection drops.\r\n•\tSecure your iPhone data with next-generation encryption complemented with top-notch VPN protocols: NordLynx based on WireGuard and IKEv2/IPsec.\r\n\nAS EASY AS 1-2-3\r\n•\tDownload, log in, and connect – that’s it! With NordVPN, one tap is enough to encrypt your whole traffic.\r\n•\tSet the app to connect automatically and enjoy full peace of mind.\r\n•\tBrowse the Help Center, write an email, or visit our website for a live chat. Our award-winning customer support team is ready to assist you all day, every day.\r\n\nWORLDWIDE ENTERTAINMENT\r\n•\tStream without interruptions and access your favorite video content from anywhere.\r\n•\tConnect to any gaming server, take advantage of an early game release on another side of the world, and protect yourself from DDoS attacks.\r\n•\tSay goodbye to bandwidth throttling. With NordVPN, there will be no data caps or speed limits.\r\n\nPROTECT EVERYTHING\r\n•\tYour iPhone is probably not the only connected device you have. Use NordVPN to protect your laptop, tablet, and smart TV, or share your account with your family.\r\n•\tInstall NordVPN on your Wi-Fi router and enjoy a private internet connection on every connected device in your home.\r\n\nGET YOUR TECHIE HAT ON\r\n•\tYou can set a custom DNS address or pick your preferred network protocol.\r\n•\tBrowse our Specialty Servers list for extra protection. Double VPN, Obfuscated, P2P – we have servers to match your needs.\r\n \r\nBottom line? You need NordVPN if you want to:\r\n•\tHide your IP address and location.\r\n•\tStay safe when hopping on public Wi-Fi or any other network.\r\n•\tBrowse the internet without the fear of being watched and tracked.\r\n \r\nIt’s easy. Online security is just a tap away – wind down, connect to NordVPN, and enjoy safe and private internet access wherever you go.\r\n \r\nWireGuard® is a registered trademark of Jason A.
